## #1 Option to manually input synchronization value.
When the program has to be restarted several times due to other errors, it would save time if we could skip the synchronization step, by just manually typing in the synchronization value of the last run.

#### 2011-05-12, 03:57:30 - Tamas Heffter
You can set synchronization value at USDataCollectionConfig.xml by changing the ImageAcqusition tag LocalTimeOffset attribute. 
For example, if you have -234ms video offset, you have to edit config file like: LocalTimeOffset='-0.234'

## #3 DRB visibility feedback in Recording phase
It would be better to list the active DRBs in the Recording phase, and show individually a VISIBLE or NOT VISIBLE label next to them.
When both the reference and the probe are moving, it's not always obvious which DRB went out of view.

#### 2011-05-09, 14:18:51 - Andras Lasso
Tried and it works for me on both Windows 7 and XP. Very good!

The only problem was that git sometimes couldn't update the repository: built in debug mode fine, then changed build configuration to release, started the build and there were multiple errors (could not delete itk library, not a git repository, ...); after restarting the build a few times and forcing a rebuild on failed projects fixed the problem. Maybe it's the fault of the git implementation in cygwin? If others have this problem as well then we should find out something.

Need to update the build instructions on the wiki: the superbuild method should be the primary, supported building method.

Hi Tomi,

Tamas and I just did one round of freehand calibration using the converted data, but we found the transform data was all recorded in millimeters (Tx, Ty, Tz).  This caused huge errors in calibration because the original program assumes all transformations are in meters, :-).

Could you kindly help us convert the transform to meters for the same dataset (fcal-data02-24bit)?

Thanks a lot,

Cheers,

- Thomas

I couldn't really get this:
- Call the phantom definition parser from Initialize() function
because vtkCalibrationController's Initialize function only instantiates members, no configuration reading is done there, they are called separately.

But the other requests I did, and the parser function is called from vtkCalibrationController::ReadCalibrationControllerConfiguration

## #26 Phantom registration sometimes fails
Phantom registration automatic test fails sometimes, because the computed values are off. The odd thing is that the generated input should be always the same, but it still fails about 1 out of 4 runs.

Added initial gnuplot script for center of rotation calculation error plot

#### 2011-06-01, 14:36:44 - Tamas Heffter
The gnuplot script need to change in order to display the error for each wire (#1, #3, #4, #6). 
=> Need to find a good way to display the center of rotations in different Z positions (e.g 3D representation with splot).

## #38 Create CAD model about probe calibration coordinate systems
-all the coordinate frames that are used in the software should be included (such as ProbeHome)
-all the stepper axes should be included (2 translation and 1 rotation)
-there are no xyz labels on the coordinate system axes
-it seems that the coordinate axes are just drawn in 2D, which limits the use of the model (the main advantage of a 3D model is that we can freely rotate and zoom it to visualize any coordinate system)
-3D model is needed, not just a 2D snapshot (and it should be uploaded to svn to USTemplateCalibration\\docs\\iCAL\\CoordinateSystems instead of being sent in email)

Add the following arguments to SequenceMetafileConverter:

If the number of frames reached the max-number-of-frames-in-seq-metafile than the converter should save the files into a single sequence metafile. 

The converter should decide to add increasing numbers to the file name if it has to write more frames than max-number-of-frames-in-seq-metafile. 

The final SequenceMetafile output name should look like this: 
output-folder / output-sequence-file-name [0001] . output-sequence-file-extension

## #48 Ignore data that was acquired during high-speed motion
Due to jitter in image and position data acquisition rate (which is inevitable if using a non-real-time operating system) there is always some temporal desynchronization of the data sources. Temporal desynchronization leads to spatial errors, the larger the the speed of motion, the larger the spatial error.

To limit the maximum possible error due to temporal desynchronization all the data that is acquired during high-speed motion (when the probe was moved faster than a threshold speed) should be ignored for operations that require high accuracy (such as calibration, validation, volume reconstruction).

Threshold should be set manually in the acquisition configuration (or optionally, computed automatically from the acquisition rate jitter).

#### 2011-05-20, 20:37:10 - Tamas Heffter
The implementation should go to vtkTrackedFrameList::ValidateSpeed() 

#### 2011-06-07, 22:56:32 - Tamas Heffter
When returning a synchronized frame compute and return the motion speed ( translation, rotation) as well. Then caller can decide if the frame is reliable or not. If not reliable then it can drop it and maybe display a warning (move the probe slower).

#### 2011-08-08, 14:22:58 - Csaba Pinter
Tomi:
* Please review my changes here and approve if they are OK
* Note: There is a possible source of error here: the speed is computed from the data of the parameter frame and the last added frame, and it computes the average speed since the last added frame. If we decide to add or not to add according to this, the new frame is not added until the average speed decreases below the threshold
* Note2: Maybe the ValidateData should return false once it encounters an error in one of the validate functions, so that it does not have to run the rest (eg. if the timestamp if not valid, it runs all the other validate functions as well, although the first criterium would be enough to drop the frame)

The trackedFrame is typically somewhat lags behind the latestFrame. This is necessary because this is the only way to ensure that the corresponding video frame has been acquired and tracking data after the video frame has also been acquired (needed for position interpolation). Therefore, the speed shall be measured by comparing the position and timestamp difference of trackedFrame and one frame before trackedFrame (or even better: trackedFrame-1 and trackedFrame+1). 

A few other comments:
* fabs should be used for both orientation and position or neither of them (double velocityPosition = diffPosition / diffTime; double velocityOrientation = fabs( diffOrientation / diffTime ))
* Remove (or change to LOG_TRACE): LOG_WARNING('---- VelocityPosition = ... 
* Add units: PlusMath::GetOrientationDifferenceDeg, diffOrientationDeg, MaxVelocityPositionMmPerSec, MaxVelocityOrientationDegPerSec
* Have a PLUS_STATUS return value for indicating whether there was an error computing the velocity and a separate parameter (such as bool &isSpeedAcceptable) for the return value

(In r:539) Re #48: Debug logging removed; fabs is applied to position too

#### 2011-08-09, 14:06:58 - Tamas Heffter
You can measure the difference between the last saved tracked frame and the latest frame in the buffer like this: 
fabs(LastFrameInListTimestamp - NewFrameTimestamp)/fabs(lastFrameInListFrameIndex - NewFrameIndex).
For this, we should guarantee that the frame indexes are always increasing 

Or, just compare the two last frames in the buffer. For this, probably it would be easier to implement it in the TrackerBuffer, like GetFrameSpeed(BufferUidType uid, double &speed) and add the speed as a member to TrackedFrame class. 

#### 2011-08-09, 14:11:12 - Csaba Pinter
The ValidateData is used to decide if the just aquired frame would be added to the list or not. If I compare the last two frames in the buffer, then if the speed was too high once, it would never add a frame from that time on.
We have two choices: separate the speed validation from the rest of the validations, or use the just acquired frame and the last frame in the buffer.

If the issue is a duplicate then it's better to set it to Invalid instead of Fixed.
Fixed means something has changed in the software, it's a new feature, bugfix, etc.
Invalid means that the ticket itself is the problem and no code change is necessary.

- Modal window

#### 2011-06-22, 20:35:07 - Andras Lasso
The device set could have a short name (that appears in the listbox) and a full description could appear in a multi-line textbox below the listbox (and/or as a tooltip) for the selected item.

#### 2011-06-22, 21:59:51 - Csaba Pinter
Yes, it is already that way, but still, the names (eg. 'Tracking and video data is read from sequence metafile.') are sometimes too long to fit in the combobox in that narrow toolbox.
I could also make the toolbox resizeable by adding a splitter between it and the canvas, but I wouldn't do that if it was up to me.
For now, I leave it this way, and add a ticket when everything else is done in this one, and we can discuss it when you get back to Kingston.

Basically it works, but there is an issue that needs discussion.

We agreed that in the tool definitions, we have one Calibration element, which is the StylusTipToStylus in the case of a stylus, and ImageToProbe in the case of a probe. But a probe has another calibration: the ProbeToProbeReference. We have to find a way to integrate it into our configuration file (in the tool definition section)

Probe MotelToTool transform is not entirely accurate, but the visualization works fine. This probe model to tool registration has to be done each time the DRB is moved

## #70 Event cannot be handled: Device not connected
Currently, vtkDataCollector::Connect() function calls 'exit( EXIT_FAILURE )' if the video source or the tracker cannot be initialized. This doesn't allow application developers to fully control when to close the application. The 'exit' or 'return' functions shouldn't be allowed anywhere in PlusLib, because the prevent error handling at the application level.

## #72 SegmentationParameters definition in the configuration file is ambiguous
Name of segmentation parameters in the xml config file are not easy to understand. Need to change the names to contain unit (pixel, mm, percent, etc.) and to make the definition more clear, such as:

FrameSize='820 616' => this shall not be an input parameter (it's a very basic property of the input image)
ScalingEstimation='0.078' => ApproximateImageSpacing
SearchRegionX='27 793' => SearchRegionTopLeftPixels (not just rename but reorganization of the 4 values)
SearchRegionY='27 589' => SearchRegionBottomRightPixels (not just rename but reorganization of the 4 values)
ThresholdImageTop='10.0' => ThresholdImagePercentTopHalfFrame
ThresholdImageBottom='10.0' => ThresholdImagePercentBottomHalfFrame
FindLines3PtDist='5.3' => CollinearPointsMaxDistanceFromLineMm

Make SearchRegion optional, so that when it is not specified the full image is used as search region.

Need to fix it as early as possible, in all the configuration files.

Probably the cleanest is to define the search region by two points (top-left and bottom-right) because then the two points can be simply transformed with the image (when it is transformed to the standard MF orientation). See #121.

## #79 Revise video and tracking buffer 
Remove Seek, AutoAdvance, Play functions from the buffers, and clean up the unnecessary codes. 
Write pointer should point to the next field in the buffer and the read pointer should count from (write pointer - 1) if number of items larger than 0.

1.
Having a unique frame ID (uid) could be useful. The ID starts from 0 when the buffer is created and it increases when a new frame is added. It is never reset (even when the buffer is emptied). This way you can just notify all interested components about a new frame acquisition by  publishing this unique frame ID, and the component can retrieve the frame by referring to that using this ID. If the frame is not available anymore it can be detected easily.
-If we just have the index in the buffer (0..buffersize-1) then it's not easy to detect if the frame is still/already available or not.
-If we just have a relative index (relative to the last acquired frame) then if we acquire a new image we no longer have an up-to-date reference. So, it's not a reliable reference.
 
2.
The public interface for accessing the buffer could be:
typedef long int FrameUidType;
enum FrameStatus { FRAME_OK, FRAME_NOT_AVAILABLE_YET, FRAME_NOT_AVAILABLE_ANYMORE };
FrameStatus GetLatestFrame(): get the most recent data, e.g., for visualization (we don't care when exactly it was acquired we just want to show it)
FrameStatus GetFrame (FrameUidType uid): get a frame using the unique identifier
FrameStatus GetFrame(Timestamp ts): get a frame by timestamp
 
3.
For display there is no need to do any synchronization (I don't know if we do any), just show the latest image at the latest position (it might be too complex to implement a waiting mechanism for the matching data and the result might be just larger visible lag for the user).
 
4.
For processing (e.g., saving synchronized image+tracker data) it's important to check if the frame and transform are already acquired. This can be verified by the return value of the GetFrame(timestamp) and GetTransform(timestamp) methods. These methods shall return FRAME_NOT_YET_AVAILABLE and TRANSFORM_NOT_YET_AVAILABLE status when requesting a data with a timestamp that is later than the last acquired item to prevent extrapolation. Then the caller method can detect the error and either retry the request after some delay (or just display/log the error, work with the latest available data and let the user to change the data collection settings to prevent this happening again).

Fixed comments after code review: 
DataCollector
 
Is the DataCollector supposed to be thread-safe? If yes, then there must not be any member variable like this->CurrentVideoBufferItem, because e.g., the PlusStatus vtkDataCollector::GetMostRecentTimestamp(double &ts)method can be called from multiple threads at the same time and after you call this->GetVideoSource()->GetBuffer()->GetLatestVideoBufferItem(this->CurrentVideoBufferItem)on one thread, the other thread can overwrite the this->CurrentVideoBufferItem. The temporary buffer item must not be a member variable but a local variable (on stack) or an input variable (from the method that calls vtkDataCollector::GetMostRecentTimestamp). The same applies to MostRecentFrameBufferIndex (it shall not be a member variable because it can be changed at any time by another thread).

Copying the total buffer (including the image data) just to get the timestamp is too expensive. It would be much more efficient if the buffer could directly return the most recent timestamp.
 
Replace vtkDataCollector::TrackingOnly by and vtkDataCollector::VideoOnly by TrackingEnabled and VideoEnabled (and change the program logic accordingly). TrackingOnly and VideoOnly names are really bad, because they can describe a contradictory state (if both are true) and very confusing (TrackingOnly refers to the availability video signal; VideoOnly refers to the tracking).
 
#define SYNCHRO_SIGNAL_NOGATING 1
#define SYNCHRO_SIGNAL_FAKE 2
#define SYNCHRO_SIGNAL_HEART 3
#define SYNCHRO_SIGNAL_USB 4
Replace these #defines by an enum (or remove? they don't seem to be used)
 
#define SYNCHRO_VIDEO_NTSC 1
#define SYNCHRO_VIDEO_PAL 2
Replace these #defines by an enum (or remove? they don't seem to be used)
 
virtual PlusStatus Synchronize(const bool saveSyncData = false);
save to where?
I guess we usually know if we want to save/discard the result after the sync is complete.
 
DumpTrackerToMetafile
Write would be more appropriate than Dump
 
DumpVideoBufferToMetafile
Write would be more appropriate than Dump
 
                // Description:
                // Get frame data with timestamp
                virtual PlusStatus GetFrameWithTimestamp(vtkImageData* frame, double& frameTimestamp);  
Is timestamp an input or an output variable? If it's not input then which frame do you get with this?
 
virtual int GetNextActiveToolNumber();
It's unclear what you can use this method for. Just for getting the next available tool after the current one? Is there a method to set the current tool?
Same for Previous.
 
int vtkDataCollector::GetNextActiveToolNumber()
The implementation logic is so complex that I'm not sure if it's correct.
Why we need the loop variable instead of just returning with error if nextToolNumber >= numberOfTools?
 
int vtkDataCollector::GetNextActiveToolNumber()
Return with an error code instead of a special value (-1) to signal error. It would make the error handling more clear. Why don't we return with error if there is no more active tools (instead of returning with the default port number)? Especially because the default port might not even be active.
 
DumpBufferSize
WriteBufferSize would be nicer.
 
vtkSetMacro(Initialized,bool);
I don't think this should be protected.
 
virtual PlusStatus ReadConfiguration();
From where? At least it should be documented what does it do (but a more descriptive name would be even better).
 
All member variable shall be deleted in the destructor, a couple of them might not be deleted now (CurrentVideoBufferItem, ConfigFileName, etc.)
 
void vtkDataCollector::PrintSelf(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent)
Isn't there anything to be printed?
 
 
if ( this->GetTracker() != NULL )
      {
            if ( !this->GetTracker()->Connect() )
            {
                  LOG_ERROR('Unable to initialize tracker!');
                  return PLUS_FAIL;
            }
      }
It's better to return immediately if you encounter an error:
if ( this->GetTracker() == NULL )
      {
                                log error
                                return with error
                }
 
PlusStatus vtkDataCollector::Connect()
Why don't we use the VideoEnabled and TrackerEnabled flags here?
 
 
this->GetVideoSource()->Record();
this->GetTracker()->StartTracking();
These names are inconsistend. Both should be Record() or they should be StartVideo() and StartTracking()
 
// reserve enough transformation capacity for each tool
this->ToolTransMatrices.clear();
...
I guess this should be done before starting tracking
 
PlusStatus vtkDataCollector::Start()
What happens if we started already? Shouldn't we check for that?
 
PlusStatus vtkDataCollector::CopyTrackerBuffer( vtkTrackerBuffer* trackerBuffer, int toolNumber )
{
...
      if ( trackerBuffer == NULL )
      {
            trackerBuffer = vtkTrackerBuffer::New();
      }
I don't understand why you do this. Noone will be able to access trackerBuffer after you return this method, so it'll leak. If the calling method didn't provide a memory address where the results can be copied (trackerBuffer==NULL) then the method should simple return with failure.
Same for tracker.
 
PlusStatus vtkDataCollector::DumpTrackerToMetafile( vtkTracker* tracker, const char* outputFolder, const char* metaFileName, bool useCompression /*= false*/ )
Do you use any member variable? If not then it should be a static method.
 
const int percent = floor( (100.0*i) / (1.0*numberOfItems));
Compute percent only if you use it (move it into the nested if block).
 
PlusStatus vtkDataCollector::Synchronize( const bool saveSyncData /*=false*/ )
Saving the buffers to metafiles should depend on current log level (should be done only if it's at least debug level).
 
vtkDataCollector::GetMainToolName
this->GetTracker()->GetTool(this->GetDefaultToolPortNumber())
The names should be consistent Main/Default (I would prefer default).
 
startTime != -1.0
It's unreliable to compare a floating point variable to a constant (it may be possible that the constant cannot be exactly represented by the variable, e.g., it's not -1 but -0.99999999999999 and so the comparison can fail). A solution could be to remove the default parameter and require the caller to provide the parameter.
 
void vtkDataCollector::ConvertVtkImageToItkImage(vtkImageData* inFrame, TrackedFrame::ImageType* outFrame)
Add comments about why the flipping is necessary.
 
vtkMatrix4x4* vtkDataCollector::GetToolTransMatrix( unsigned int toolNumber/* = 0 */)
int vtkDataCollector::GetToolFlags( unsigned int toolNumber/* = 0 */)
I would prefer to have proper error code return instead of merging the output value with the status code.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------
 
vtkTimestampedCircularBuffer
 
template<class BufferItemType>
void vtkTimestampedCircularBuffer<BufferItemType>::SetBufferSize(int bufsize)
Why don't you use error code when the method fails?
 
std::deque<BufferItemType*> BufferItemContainer;
Why didn't you use std::deque<BufferItemType> BufferItemContainer? You could have avoided the allocation/deallocation magic in void vtkTimestampedCircularBuffer<BufferItemType>::SetBufferSize(int bufsize).
 
BufferItemType* vtkTimestampedCircularBuffer<BufferItemType>::GetBufferItem(const int bufferIndex)
{
      if (this->GetBufferSize() <= 0
            || bufferIndex >= this->GetBufferSize()
            || bufferIndex < 0 )
      {
            return NULL;
      }
Log error when return with NULL
 
void vtkTimestampedCircularBuffer<BufferItemType>::DeepCopy(vtkTimestampedCircularBuffer<BufferItemType>* buffer)
You have a pointer vector, so you need to copy each element by value (creating a new object & copy the contents of each BufferItem). Even better, use just a std::deque<BufferItemType> BufferItemContainer, then copy would be trivial.
 
void vtkTimestampedCircularBuffer<BufferItemType>::DeepCopy(vtkTimestampedCircularBuffer<BufferItemType>* buffer)
Need to lock while doing the copy, otherwise you might get inconsistent content in the copied object.
 
void vtkTimestampedCircularBuffer<BufferItemType>::DeepCopy(vtkTimestampedCircularBuffer<BufferItemType>* buffer)
Need to lock while changing all the values.
 
double vtkTimestampedCircularBuffer<BufferItemType>::GetFrameRate(bool ideal /*=false*/)
return 1 not needed
 
--------------------------------
 
VideoBuffer
 
VideoBufferItem::VideoBufferItem(const VideoBufferItem &videoItem)
...
if (!videoItem.GetFrame()->CopyData(this->Frame->GetVoidPointer(0), this->Frame->GetFrameExtent(), this->Frame->GetFrameExtent(), this->Frame->GetPixelFormat()))
Why don't you just use the videoItem's DeepCopy?
 
PlusStatus VideoBufferItem::DeepCopy(VideoBufferItem* videoItem)
...
if (!videoItem.GetFrame()->CopyData(this->Frame->GetVoidPointer(0), this->Frame->GetFrameExtent(), this->Frame->GetFrameExtent(), this->Frame->GetPixelFormat()))
Why don't you just use the videoItem's DeepCopy?
 
PlusStatus SetFrame(unsigned char *imageDataPtr,
            const int frameSizeInPx[3],
            const int numberOfBitsPerPixel,
            const int   numberOfBytesToSkip );
Shall the caller delete the buffer or the VideoBufferItem will do that? Need to document who has the ownership to the imageDataPtr buffer after this call.
 
PlusStatus SetFrame(vtkVideoFrame2* frame);
Need to document who has the ownership to the imageDataPtr buffer after this call.
 
PlusStatus SetFrame(vtkImageData* frame);
Need to document who has the ownership to the imageDataPtr buffer after this call.
 
while (--rows >= 0)
Why dont' you just wrote a usual for loop (for (r=0; r<rows; r++) )?
You saved the creation of an extra index variable (that's negligible) but made the code more difficult to read.
Also, the current implementation crashes if rows is an unsigned integer and the initial value of rows is 0.
 
vtkVideoBuffer::~vtkVideoBuffer()
{
      this->FrameFormat->Delete();
}
Safer to check for NULL before delete and set to NULL after delete.
 
vtkVideoBuffer::~vtkVideoBuffer()
Why don't you delete VideoBuffer in the destructor?
 
// Update video buffer
virtual void UpdateBuffer();
What does this method do?? Update the name and/or documentation.
 
LOG_DEBUG( 'vtkVideoBuffer: Failed to prepare for adding new frame to video buffer!');
return PLUS_FAIL;
Why just LOG_DEBUG?
 
LOG_WARNING( 'vtkVideoBuffer: Failed to get pointer to video buffer object from the video buffer for the new frame!');
return PLUS_FAIL;
Why just LOG_WARNING?
 
PlusStatus vtkVideoBuffer::AddItem(unsigned char *imageDataPtr,
This method seems to be unsafe. You expect this sequence of operation:
1. New frame is prepared in the buffer:  this->VideoBuffer->PrepareForNewFrame(filteredTimestamp, itemUid, bufferIndex) != PLUS_SUCCESS )
2. Set the timestamp value for the latest  frame: newObjectInBuffer->SetFilteredTimestamp(filteredTimestamp);
3. DataCollector retrieves the timestamp of the latest frame
However, the 1 (acquisition thread), 3 (rendering thread), 2 (acquisition thread) order can occur just as well and I think in this case you return an incorrect timestamp value. I would introduce a FinalizeNewFrame method that signals that the new frame has been fully set up. Check all the public methods of the buffer whether they work correctly if you call them after prepare but before finalize (especially GetLatestItemUidInBuffer and GetOldestItemUidInBuffer).

int vtkTimestampedCircularBuffer<BufferItemType>::GetBufferIndex( const BufferItemUidType uid )
Use proper return status instead of hiding the error code in special values (not just here, everywhere).
E.g., current code crashes at the BufferItemContainer[bufferIndex] call in  ItemStatus vtkTimestampedCircularBuffer<BufferItemType>::GetFilteredTimeStamp(const BufferItemUidType uid, double &filteredTimestamp)if the uid is removed from the buffer after the GetFrameStatus check (you don't lock the buffer, so nothing prevents the item from being overwritten).

## #84 Building problem
Hi there,

I'm trying to build the PlusBuild. Cmake successfully made the Plus-bin folder but when I try to build the ALL_BUILD project in Visual Studio 2008 I get the following two errors:

Error  1  error PRJ0019: A tool returned an error code from 'Performing configure step for 'PlusLib''  PlusLib
Error  2  error PRJ0019: A tool returned an error code from 'Performing configure step for 'PlusApp''  PlusApp

Any ideas about what the problem might be? 

Thanks in advance,
Mohammad

Could you please attach the BuildLog.htm file (it's in ...\\PlusLib.dir\elease\\BuildLog.htm or ...\\PlusLib.dir\\Debug\\BuildLog.htm)?

If you fully configure the project in CMake then configure step shouldn't be needed in Visual Studio. What output is displayed in CMake when you generate the project? (you can just start CMake and press Generate button, no problem that you've already generated the project)

Hi,
This is the output of the Cmake:

So it shows no signs of problem. right?

Thanks

#### 2011-06-29, 01:24:06 - Andras Lasso
CMake configure step seems OK, but the BuildLog.htm shows the details of the error:
CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:
NDIOAPI_INCLUDE_DIR

So, the problem is that you enabled Certus tracking, but the NDI libraries were not defined. At Queen's we store the NDI libraries in a separate repository (PLTools) and they are discovered automatically.

Do you see the NDIOAPI_INCLUDE_DIR variable in CMake if you set the PlusLib-bin directory as 'Where to build libraries'?
- If you see the NDIOAPI_INCLUDE_DIR variable, then set it as follows:
        NDIOAPI_INCLUDE_DIR -> Path to the NDI oapi SDK include directory. (it contains ndopto.h)
        FIND_PATH(NDIOAPI_BINARY_DIR -> Path to the NDI oapi SDK binary directory.' (it contains oapi.dll)
- If you don't see the variable, you need to ask help from Tomi Heffter (he either gives you access right to the PLTools repository or fix the CMake files to make the variable visible).


#### 2011-06-29, 17:34:34 - Tamas Heffter
Mohammad, 

Please accept the invitation to the PLTools project and check the PLUSBUILD_USE_PLTools check box in CMake and build the PlusBuild again.

## #86 Change vtkVideoFrame custom image container to itkImageData
Use itkImage instead of unsigned char *Array to clearly define image storage. 
This case, we don't have to duplicate memory for video buffer writing into metafile. 
 
Remove the following memory allocation from vtkDataCollector::WriteVideoBufferToMetafile method: 


~~~~

        // Allocate memory for new frame
        int* videoFrameSize = videoBuffer->GetFrameFormat()->GetFrameSize(); 
        TrackedFrame::ImageType::Pointer frame = TrackedFrame::ImageType::New(); 
        TrackedFrame::ImageType::SizeType size = {videoFrameSize[0], videoFrameSize[1]};
        TrackedFrame::ImageType::IndexType start = {0,0};
        TrackedFrame::ImageType::RegionType region;
        region.SetSize(size);
        region.SetIndex(start);
        frame->SetRegions(region);
        frame->Allocate();

Enable filtering on types of messages => we can change log level, it's enough
Make it resizeable => done

## #90 Add automated tests for GUI components
See this open-source project (developed at MIT) for automated GUI testing: http://sikuli.org/
There is also some work about its CMake integration: http://www.insight-journal.org/browse/publication/822

We may have higher-priority tasks right now, but we have to keep this in mind and try GUI testing as soon as we can.

#### 2011-07-06, 15:41:24 - Csaba Pinter
Tomi's comment: 'We had a chance to see it during the project week. It has some disadvantages (e.g. it depends on the screen size, so they are using pixel positions instead of windows id to click on an object)...'

I think those disadvantages make this almost unusable (if we change even the spacing in our Qt forms, then we have to modify all the tests related to those pages), but maybe it can do better than only clicking to (X,Y) positions, we will look into it.

#### 2011-07-06, 16:04:02 - Csaba Pinter
I took a deper look at Sikuli, and I think it can be quite good actually!
Instead of clicking to pixel positions, it uses screenshots to determine the point where to click, so it tolerates all kinds of re-ordering and layout changing. It even has some tolerance for appearance changes, since it uses an algorithm that matches the screenshot in our script to the actual screen, and it returns with the best match, so it doesn't need to be identical.
So it's even simpler to use than the keyword-driven testing, which is considered to be state-of-the-art.
I think it's worth a try.

## #92 Finalize configuration file structure

#### 2011-07-18, 15:49:10 - Csaba Pinter
With Tomi we agreed in the following:
* Phantom registration result should go to the PhantomDefinition file under Geometry/Registration tag
* Other tool calibrations (ImageToProbe, StylusTipToStylus etc.) go in the USDataCollectionConfig under the Tool/Calibration tag (indicating date and error)
* The configuration data should be represented mainly (from the initial loading) by vtkXMLDataElement objects, which are passed to the proper class (eg. vtkDataCollector wants the Tracker to save its configuration. It passes the data element that contains the Tracker tag to the tracker, which further distributes the Tool tags to the TrackerTools. No  member variables should be used)

#### 2011-07-10, 14:20:36 - Csaba Pinter
The problem was that I didn't check the PlusBuild_use_PLTools in CMake. But if it prevents the build to succeed, do we really need that option? It's like we could ckeck build_will_fail

Clif,

We have an ISO CDROM image file of the Terason SDK that includes a standard Terason Version 4.0 application that Chris Alex used to write a Terason RF frame data capture application. It is about 50MB in size and can be sent through the AMS SVN web server. If there is any Terason API information that we have it should be in this file.

#### 2011-07-19, 12:39:03 - Andras Lasso
Detailed testing (using an oscillating positioning stage) on one data set shows that there is no variable delay in neither the video nor the tracker data (using the Ulterius interface, running Plus on a separate PC at about 15fps).

See a comparison of the position vs. time curves on the attached 2011-07-15_time-synch-test-compareVideoTracker.pdf  file.

The full data set can be found on the image server (s:\\data\  rackedUltrasoundValidation\\2011-07-15_time-synch-test).

Tamas, please acquire a few more data sets and check the position vs. time curves. Maybe also ask Tomi to do a few more tests with different settings (various fps, trackers, ulterius/framegrabber, same/different PC, etc.).

If the curves are as nice as in the 2011-07-15_time-synch-test data set then we can move on to tuning the synchronization algorithm (maybe we can add a calibration phantom based sync algo (that optimizes the correlation between reported position info in the tracker and video stream).

This is OK for a quick fix, but it must not remain like this! Waiting 0.001 means 1000fps - this might lead to unexpected results due to smoothing of the data. Also, you don't want to artificially slow down the execution of the algorithm.

Instead of using the current timestamps, use the timestamps that are in the input file. If timestamps are not available then you should just generate some generic timestamp values (e.g., by assuming a generic 15fps or so frame rate).

## #119 Use STL binary search in vtkTimestampedCircularBuffer<BufferItemType>::GetItemUidFromTime
ItemStatus vtkTimestampedCircularBuffer<BufferItemType>::GetItemUidFromTime(const double time, BufferItemUidType& uid )
No need to reimplement such things. You can simply use STL search methods: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/binary_search/

#### 2011-07-09, 19:40:00 - Tamas Heffter
In order to use STL binary search, we need to define our iterator to be able to iterate over buffer items. This is a circular buffer, so we cannot just use the deque iterator (e.g. begin  should be the OldestItem and the end should be the LatestItem) to iterate over the items (it's not sorted, we don't want to sort it or make a copy from the whole buffer). 
Do you think it will worth it? 


#### 2014-05-28, 03:57:27 - Andras Lasso
We already do a binary search in vtkTimestampedCircularBuffer<BufferItemType>::GetItemUidFromTime, so using the STL algorithm does not seem to have any particular advantage.

#### 2011-07-09, 22:01:49 - Andras Lasso
The results seem good, but there are minor differences compared to the baseline (probably due to segmentation differences) and large differences (probably due to standardization of the image orientation).

## #121 Fiducial segmentation clipping rectangle is expected in MF orientation
Fiducial segmentation clipping rectangle is expected in MF orientation, instead of the native orientation of the image. This is quite error-prone, as the user may set the clipping rectangle using values got from an external program (such as imagej), which does not reorient the image to MF.

Need to apply the same transform to the clipping rectangle coordinates as the transform that is applied to the image (transform from native orientation to standard MF orientation).

#### 2011-07-15, 15:21:24 - Tamas Heffter
We don't know what is the orientation of the input image, so the best bet is to define the ROI in the default (MF) orientation in the config xml file.

The first one seems out of date. Isn't there an actual version already in the Plus wiki? (Superbuild)
The second is the old obsolete system. We shouldn't use it once the new system works. And it doesn't use Plus at all.
The third one may go without any change...

## #139 Merge top and bottom image threshold image segmentation parameters
There used to be a separate threshold value for the top half and the bottom half of the image (because it was difficult to find a single threshold value that worked well for the whole image for gel-based phantoms). We don't support the gel-based phantom any more, so there is no need for these two different thresholds. CIRS phantom is gel-based but it has lines in the whole image region anyway, so two thresholds wouldn't really help - needs experiments to determine what kind of thresholding could work.

Rename ThresholdImageTop to ThresholdImage. Delete ThresholdImageBottom. In the code and all the config files as well.

## #141 Move image origin to center of the nearest line
Ultrasonix uses an image coordinate system where the origin is the middle of the row nearest to the transducer. This has an advantage that scaling the image (e.g. changing the depth) doesn't change the origin location. So just by knowing the scaling rate, Image-To-Probe calibrations can be computed, and don't have to be recalculated with a calibration phantom. We may want to switch to this coordinate system at some point.

Thanks! Having printf in GrabbieLib is not an issue (people won't copy code from GrabbieLib to Plus, so Plus will remain consistent) and it's better to keep GrabbieLib modifications at the minimum, as it's difficult for us to test it.


## #151 Clean up quaternion to matrix conversion
Migrated from Mantis (252)

Currently there are 3-4 different ways for converting quaternion to matrix:
-convertTransform2HomoMatrix
-vtkQuaternionToMatrix3x3 in USTemplateCalibration
-vtkMath::vtkQuaternionToMatrix3x3
-vtkTransform::RotateWXYZ
(a reference implementation in Matlab is available here: http://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/~pk/Research/MatlabFns/Rotations/quaternion2matrix.m) [^]

Use only one implementation (preferably one that is implemented in VTK) and remove all the others.
If the VTK implementation is buggy (the normalization in vtkMath::vtkQuaternionToMatrix3x3 is suspicious) then a bug report shall be filed for VTK. 


vtkMath::vtkQuaternionToMatrix3x3 should be used;

WARNING There is a bug that it has to be normalized, else it does not work (it is fixed in VTK but for safety normalization should be done)

## #153 Fix large variation in temporal calibration 
Migrated from Mantis (221)

Temporal calibration (computation of time difference between US and tracker data) has large variation, up to +/-0.15 seconds.
First step of the analysis would be to check timestamps in each data flow (US and tracker) and see what is the variation in the time difference between the timestamps.




- Check CreateTimeStampForFrame when log in remotely
- Check jitter plot
- Add frame index to buffer (SonixVideo)
- Check CreateTimeStampForFrame when missing frame timestamps
- Check synchronization when missing frame timestamps
- Try it with compression 


On CISC/HEART the resolution of the system clock was around 15 ms and using 20ms sleep interval effect around 30 ms sleep (after 10s stabilization) and inaccurate frame rate.
So we decided to use accurate timer (windows multimedia timer, using 1ms resolution) which solved the stepper acquisition rate difference within 2s ( see Sleep_vs_AccurateTimer.xls) on expected time interval.


If image acquisition through ulterius interface on a separate machine has too large variation in frame delay then the image acquisition could be performed on the ultrasonix PC:

Using Ulterius 2.x the images can be transferred through shared memory instead of TCP/IP:
http://www.ultrasonix.com/wikisonix/index.php?title=Ulterius_Data_Acquisition#Shared_Memory [^]

Alternatively, the Porta SDK can be used for real-time acquisition:
'When more flexibility is required, the Ulterius package is suggested, as data can be transferred to a client program in real-time through a TCP/IP or shared memory interface. When even more flexibility and real-time functionality is needed, Porta is the logical next step, as callbacks that link directly to the cine buffer are available, as well as real-time processed image access (ie. scan converted and post-process filtered data). '
http://www.ultrasonix.com/wikisonix/index.php?title=Porta [^]

If none of the above options work then it could be possible to use more advanced synchronization methods (using the BNC sync inputs/ouputs on the Ultrasonix system). However, such a configuration would be quite complex and device-specific. Compared to that using a framegrabber seems to be a better option (simpler, much less device-dependent, although slightly worse image quality).

Hi Parvin,
 
Yeah, it was too bad we didn't get a chance to chat at SPIE. Both Jeff and I were extremely busy this year, but that is a good thing.
 
I think Jeff Stanley is the best person to talk to about the communication methods. I have copied him on this email. He'll get back to you as soon as he can. Once that is sorted out, we can both help you out with the temporal calibration, but as I found at Robarts this is really tricky. However, this problem may be better solved with the Ultrasonix system since you have direct access to the API.
 
Cheers.
Andrew

Hi Andrew,

It was nice seeing you at SPIE; it was too bad that I didn’t get a chance to talk to you more – it was a very packed and short trip for me.

I am wondering if you could advise us on the following , or let us know who we should talk to at NDI:

1) We recently purchased an ultrasonix Touch and would like to connect our Optorak to the machine. We do not have a PCI card, and are not sure if we can install one. Could you please advise us on other possible options of networked and direct connection of the tracker to the US machine.
2) We have had problems with temporal calibration while collecting US volumes. It appears that we have delays of between 100 to 500 ms. We are working on our software components to try and address this but I am wondering if this could be related to the hardware at all. We have had this issue for the last year or even two but students have found shortcuts to address it temporarily. We need a better solution now.

Thank you for your help,
Parvin

Plus report 'Difference between unfiltered timestamp (...) and filtered timestamp (...) is larger than the threshold (0.5)' which then causes 'Failed to create filtered timestamp for buffer item with item index: ... ' error. This happens in about 10% of the acquisitions.

By investigating two cases, both seems a valid reason:

1. When the Sonix reaches a certain frameIndex (e.g., 1446) it restarts the frameIndex from 0. Probably it is normal. We don't know when to expect the restart, so we cannot really detect if it's a normal or an error case. (05_Heart_SonixVideo_Buffer.png)

2. Sometimes a tracker frame is delayed and we miss a couple of tracker frames. This is clearly an error case and we shouldn't use the delayed position. (06_Heart_NDI_Certus_Buffer_01.png)

We have two options:

A. Ignore the error and use the unfiltered timestamps as valid timestamps. In this case we may use invalid tracker data (the position is correct, but belongs to a very different time position). Outlier detection in the calibration may detect this, but it may still cause problems in other applications (such as volume reconstruction).

B. Don't ignore the errors and drop the frames where the timestamp doesn't seem to be correct. In this case we lose about 6 video frames at each frame index restart (in case of frame averaging = 20). We may change the error message to warning.

Option B seems safer, as it prevents delayed items getting into the buffer with incorrect timestamps. The side effect is to lose about 6/1500 = 0.4% of the video frames, which seem to be acceptable.

(In r:423) re #153: Changed timestamp filering errors to warnings (it may happen sometimes and it's not a problem, but if it happens too frequently then it's important to know about it)

_1. When the Sonix reaches a certain frameIndex (e.g., 1446) it restarts the frameIndex from 0. Probably it is normal. We don't know when to expect the restart, so we cannot 
really detect if it's a normal or an error case. (05_Heart_SonixVideo_Buffer.png)_

We could avoid this by just always increase the last frame number by the frame difference, so we will always get a monotone increasing frame index.

## #154 Serial communication using CablesToGo USB2Serial converter randomly fails on Windows 7
Migrated from Mantis (282)

In iCALDemo on Windows7 sometimes the position information just stops to come.

On Win7 AmsStepperTest sometimes has 'Wrong answer received' error and then doesn't quit. After unplugging the USB to serial converter the program quits. We might need to kill the AccurateTimer or do something with the serial port connection.

I started iCalBrachy on my laptop (Windows 7) and tried to connect to the stepper via the Serial2USB adaptor cable. Most of the time it could not even connect to the stepper. If it did, after a few seconds it disconnected and when tried to reconnect, it failed. 
This symptom appeared with all the 3 drivers I used (from the original install CD we found at AMS; a 2010/-7 PL2303 driver from Prolific homepage; the latest - 2011/05 - PL2303).
Using the downloaded drivers also resulted in blue screen in several cases (I think eventually it happens no matter what). The original driver did it too but less frequently.
My conclusion is that we should use Windows XP for now as the operating system for testing/presenting iCal, and try to download different drivers along with contacting the manufacturer with this problem.

Paul Neubauer reminded me that the existing registry values prevent the good drivers from installing properly. So I deleted these entries before installing the proper driver (both the description and the driver is in PLTools). I used iCalBrachy around fifteen times, and I got 1 blue screen crash, and no other symptoms. I think we can use this driver on Windows 7. Of course this blue screen thing is not good, but maybe it is even more rare than this.

Now the ImagingSource driver for the framegrabber is the bigger source of problems, because it keeps the application from closing (not even with task manager or process explorer). When this happens, the cable must be removed abd plugged back in. The image provided by this driver (x64) is also grainy.

## #162 Add full support for VS2010
Currently Visual Studio 2010 is not fully supported. It has the following limitations:
* Dependencies for PlusApp cannot be generated (therefore PlusApp cannot be built). Possible solution: merge PlusApp and PlusLib.
* VS2010 require ITK3.20 (however, ITK3.20 has a vnl_lsqr implementation that is more sensitive to poor scaling of the A matrix row/columns, which can cause problems e.g., at the timestamp filtering)
* If linking against Qt-4.7.3 pre-built binaries, then the application does not start in debug mode. Workaround: copy msvcrt debug dlls (Qt4.7.3_vcdebug_privateassembly.zip) into C:\\Qt\\4.7.3\\bin.
* If linking against Qt-4.7.3 pre-built binaries, then the application crashes when Qt STL support functions are used (such as QString::toStdString(), see http://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=11748). Workaround: don't use any Qt STL functions (replace toStdString() by toAscii().data() and fromStdString by .c_str()), more safely even disable STL support in VTK; maybe use a more recent Qt pre-built binary that is built with VS2010 runtime dlls.

Tomi, please fix the followings:
* update the ImagingControl driver in PlusLib/tools
* update PlusBuild to look for the ImagingControl driver in PlusLib/tools (you can remove 3.1 to keep the checkout size smaller), probably you have to move FindICCapturing.cmake to PlusLib (or you can just hardcode the paths, as we know that the drivers are available in PlusLib/tools for sure)
* change the build settings to enable support for ImagingControl by default (I've turned it off because now it requires PLTools)

thanks!

#### 2012-04-20, 14:40:17 - Tamas Heffter
Unfortunately you cannot just download the new ImagingControl library from the website, you have to write to the support with the serial number. So do you still want me to put it under PlusLib/tools if it's not freely available? 


#### 2012-04-20, 14:57:12 - Andras Lasso
If it's not freely downloadable anymore then keep the current implementation (find at PlusBuild level, store driver in PLTools, disabled ICCapturing by default) and remove the old driver from PlusLib/tools.

Please take a look at it here, tell you the truth I cannot tell you the status. It's freely available, but need to send a request and no more license file needed. 

#### 2012-04-20, 15:40:19 - Andras Lasso
I think after your changes it's easier to just remove the old version from PlusLib/tools. We should also remove our license number from the PlusLib repository if it's not needed anymore.

The only remaining issue is the dependencies for PlusApp?

Does ITK 4.4.0 resolve the ITK issue?

#### 2013-05-09, 16:30:50 - Andras Lasso
ITK-3.20 issue is not relevant anymore (Plus-2.x uses ITK4)
Qt toStdString() and fromStdString is not used anymore.

Remaining issues:
* Dependencies for PlusApp cannot be generated (therefore PlusApp cannot be built). Possible solution: merge PlusApp and PlusLib. => This was a problem about 1-2 years ago in CMake - it may have been fixed already
* If linking against Qt-4.7.3 pre-built binaries, then the application does not start in debug mode. Workaround: copy msvcrt debug dlls (Qt4.7.3_vcdebug_privateassembly.zip) into C:\\Qt\\4.7.3\\bin. => This has to be revisited when the officially supported Qt version will be changed in Plus (it will happen when the supported Qt version is changed in Slicer)

Project dependencies are generated correctly now (with CMake-3.0).
Recent Qt versions (e.g., Qt-4.8.5) has more recent vc debug dlls.

So, there are no more known limitations with VS2010.

Plus can be built with VS2012, too.

The Ultrasonix device resets the frame counter if any imaging parameter change happens on the console and it results frame filtering loss (and shows warning messages) until we reach the required number of frames for filtering. There is no more disconnection, no need for change.

Building with VS2010 requires ITK3.20. However, in ITK3.20 the LSQR algorithm has changed (due to licensing issues), and the new algorithm tend to fail (doesn't converge with sufficient accuracy), most probably due to the large difference in the A matrix values (norm of column 1 is much larger than the norm of column 2).

iCalB 1.0 phantom all ready:
- tapped with supporting metal poles at Hole B;
- N-wires with the same geometric specs as iCal Dry phantom;
- Added an extra wire at the same region as the template A7 origin (reference point).
- Located a new water bucket that can fit snugly with both the AMS stand and iCalB 1.0 phantom, as well as a larger/taller bucket as a back up.  (Note: the size of the bucket is still not ideal at the moment).
- Imaging with the iCalB 1.0 phantom has shown positive results with clear visibility of all wires.
- Uploaded CAD STL to SVN.

(In r:359) re #168: Probably fixed the interpolation errors. Need to test.
* Cleaned up transform interpolation: ignore invalid transforms (out of view, timeout, etc.) when finding the two source transforms, use a new; cleaner SLERP interpolation code for rotation matrix interpolation; 
* Fixed vtkTimestampedCircularBuffer::GetLatestItemUidInBuffer(): Previously it returned LatestItemUid, which is actually the next UID to be inserted into the buffer (so it was not yet in the buffer). Now it returns NextItemUid-1.
* vtkTimestampedCircularBuffer::LatestItemUid was renamed to NextItemUid, as it is the UID of the next item.
* Read frame status (if available) from metafile in vtkTrackedFrameList::ReadFromSequenceMetafile

## #170 vtkDataCollectorTest2 test fails on some machines
vtkDataCollectorTest2 test fails on some machines, such as PROSTATE. It's 100% reproducible on some machines and never appears on others.

#### 2011-07-24, 07:15:31 - Andras Lasso
(In r:372) Fixed #170: Fixed the failing tests. The problem was that the LSQR line fitting sometimes did not converge (resulted several second error). If the LSQR optimizer was forced to perform more iterations then the problem didn't appear. So, it seems that the stopping conditions for the optimization are not computed very robustly. Solution: increased the number of averaged elements to 20 (from 10) and added an additional check of the filtered and unfiltered timestamp difference (if the difference is too big then an error is logged and the element is discarded).

## #171 In vtkDataCollectorTest2 the AveragedItemsForFiltering element is not set properly
In vtkDataCollectorTest2 the AveragedItemsForFiltering element is read from the config file but then it is not actually used (the number of averaged elements is always the default).

## #175 One configuration file by using links
It would be good to use only one configuration file for everything, because it is easier to load and transfer.
However, maintaining several big all-in-one configuration files containing mainly the same information (redundantly) is difficult.
This is why is would be useful to use links, so that the root configuration file can refer to external configuration files (so we can keep the files separately, much like we do now)

(In r:1168) Fixed #176: Now vtkSavedDataTracker can load all the tools from a sequence metafile. It requires tool definition in the config file (Name, Type, and PortNumber attributes are enough: e.g., <Tracker ...> <Tool Name='ToolToTrackerTransform' Type='Probe' PortNumber='0' /> </Tracker>). The Tool Name should match the frame field name (e.g., if the transform in the sequence metafile is Seq_Frame0001_ToolToTrackerTransform = 0.438936... then the Tool Name in the config file shall be ToolToTrackerTransform)

## #177 Crash on exit due to tracker thread still running
On exiting the fCal app, it crashes almost every time, and it is due to the tracking thread trying to access the already undefined tracker instance. Maybe it would be good to undo deleting the terminate thread codes?

## #184 Build error in PlusLib during PlusBuild

## #185 Exception during Phantom Registration
Error: TrackedFramePositionFinder: Unable to find base frame transform name for tracked frame validation [in d:\\devel\\plus_assembla\\pluslib\\src\\imageacquisition\\vtkTrackedFrameList.h (148) ]

First got the error when the Phantom Registration was started (we were using the session data, and the US machine button was frozen). We then tried to reproduce the error: freezing the US machine manually during the calibration didn't cause the error. Next we tried using the session data and the same error appeared in the middle of the calibration. Another try using the session data and the calibration completed  successfully. 

The log file for when the error occurred during the calibration is attached.

## #191 Error when Reset button clicked after Phantom Registration is completed
The reset button works during the phantom registration, but if it is clicked when the calibration is complete (to do another calibration), the following error occurs:

## #197 Prepare a large (4x4 feet) color poster to showcase iCAL
We will prepare a large (4x4 feet) color poster to showcase iCAL in the roadshow..  
- This is to draw nice attention to iCAL with a high-level overview and highlights on potential clinical and commercial merits.
- The poster can be printed (charged to an account) either by the department or in Queen's Medical Imaging service.  However, we need to give at least a week time for the printing and that depends on the current schedules of the printing service as well as the potential CUPE labor strike status.

The poster needs a big hanging board to display.  Typically it is set up on the walls in a conference presentation.  But for our roadshow, there are no walls available to hang it (recall last time at AMS), so it is a bit impractical to have a poster presentation.  I have therefore abandoned this format for the roadshow.

I have added the poster contents to the powerpoint presentations and will present it with my 17 inch laptop.

want to offer the technology to others.  PTI will sell iCAL when it is

## #201 Identify tools with type instead of name
Instead of identifying the stylus using the Name='Stylus' attribute in the Tool element, we should use the StylusTool='StylusLonger' in the Tracker element (just like ReferenceTool and DefaultTool)

#### 2011-07-29, 15:23:37 - Csaba Pinter
Tool should have attributes like Name='LinearProbe' Type='Probe' Model='L14-5' (so maybe Type can act as identifier instead of the custom attributes in the element Tracker

#### 2011-08-04, 22:19:57 - Csaba Pinter
Instead of this, we decided to use the already existing Type attribute, so the tool is identified using the Type='Stylus' attribute. vtkTracker parses the string and converts it to enum like TRACKER_TOOL_STYLUS, which we use from that on throughout the program.

## #202 VolumeReconstructor handles N-F coordinates the wrong way
Currently, to have the images in the correct orientation in the output volume, the usual UltrasoundImageOrientation=MF in the recorded files has to be changed to MN. Regardless of the ImageFlipped value in the volume reconstructor config file, the 'vtkOptimizedInsertSlice' function (in file vtkFreehandUltrasound2Helper.h) puts the MF images to the volume upside down (N to F). Although in this function the 'flipped' variable is still set correctly according the 'ImageFlipped' value in the config file.

The new PlusConfiguration_... config files are missing from the package. Maybe they should be the only ones in the installer packages now, and the old ones should be removed.

## #207 No phantom image during phantom registration 
Registration completes, but the phantom doesn't appear on the screen during the phantom registration or after 'Register' is clicked. The phantom definition xml we used was: PhantomDefinition_fCal_1.0_Wiring_1.0.xml in PlusApp version 485. 

#### 2011-08-02, 18:36:15 - Csaba Pinter
It is because the old type (separate) phantom definition was loaded (and so it failed to load). Instead, the new unified configuration file has to be used in that field too.

## #209 Stylus has wrong transformation 
The stylus' position in the software does not match the position on the phantom - it appears further away.

#### 2011-08-04, 14:29:31 - Csaba Pinter
Automatic transfer of the calibration matrices is misleading. It says 'using session data' even if it comes from the original config file that contains an identity matrix. I'm going to make a fix so that the read transform is not transferred if its date is empty (when the program saves a matrix it fills the date, and the original config files contain empty dates)

## #210 TrackedFramePositionFinder cannot find base transform name after the tools were out of view

#### 2011-08-04, 18:26:39 - Csaba Pinter
According to a discussion with Tomi, I'll implement a way to save raw buffer data from fCal when this error occurs so that we can reproduce it easily (or other errors we get).

* I asked Simrin reproduce the error with the raw buffer data saving feature ready. She managed to reproduce it running on SonixTouch, but saving the buffers after it failed (Unable to allocate memory for image sequence : Failed to allocate memory for image. [in ..\\..\\..\\PlusLib\\src\\ImageAcquisition\\vtkTrackedFrameList.cxx(588)] - see \\\\image\\shared_data\\scratch\\fCalTesting\  est1 folder).
If we tried saving the buffer before this error, it worked.
* May be important: when Simrin ran the tests on my laptop, none of the usual errors came up (neither this, nor 
#212) out of more than ten tries, while on SonixTouch, the error was relatively easy to reproduce (she got the error about once out of 5)
* Easiest way to reproduce this on SonixTouch (so far): load a config file with already calibrated stylus and registered phantom. Start freehand calibration (skip temporal). After acquiring some images, hide the reference (eg. with your hand) for about 30 seconds, then continue acquisition. The application should throw errors continuously like in the attached log file.

## #211 Stylus Transform incorrect in 'Show Devices' function of Phantom Calibration
When Show Devices is being used the Stylus is not correctly oriented in the window. It appears further from the phantom then it should.

## #212 Run time exception when Phantom Calibration is Reset and Rerecorded 
We ran through the application step by step. After we finished the phantom calibration, show devices was selected and deselected. Phantom calibration was then reset followed by resetting temporal calibration (this also occurs if temporal calibration is not reset). Start was selected from the Phantom Calibration and either during or after the recording was completed, a run time exception occurred. 

#### 2011-08-04, 18:52:58 - Mattea Welch
This also happens if show devices is not selected and deselected. You get the same run time error either during or after the second recording if you reset right after the first recording and don't show the devices.

## #213 Add tracked ultrasound acquisition functionality to fCal
* New toolbox named 'Acquisition', which handles the recording (Record, Clear buffer, Save, just like in TrackedUltrasoundCapturing)
* The volume reconstruction tab changes a little. It needs an input image and a volume reconstruction configuration just like now, but if we acquired data beforehand, the input image field offers the list of recently saved metafiles (done using Acquisition). The user can still select an input image from the hard drive instead of the just recorded image

I've tested it with SonixTouch+Ascension and it seem to work! It's really impressive that you could implement all this in such a short time!

There were a few warnings (duplicate frames, recording cannot keep up with acquisition, ...) but I'm sure that it won't be to difficult to get rid of those.

## #215 StatusIcon: After opening the statusIcon widget change the icon back to green
If we change the status icon back to green after we open it, than user will be notified again if error happens (like in Slicer).

It should be MF orientation to avoid letters flipping. We need to add another wire to the phantom to make sure it's in the correct orientation (the user can easily change the image orientation from the US console).

## #226 iCalBrachy temporal calibration timestamp filtering problem
The temporal calibration seems to have some problem because of the timestamp filtering (need more investigation)

#### 2011-08-11, 23:07:15 - Andras Lasso
(In r:558) Fixed #226: reduced MinFrameThreshold from 200 to 10. Max difference was about 50, and 200 was the threshold, so the video change was not detected.
Reduced synchronization acquisition time from 30sec to 15sec, as it was not possible to save 30sec video data to file and enough synchronization points can be done in 15 seconds.

## #227 iCalBrachy stepper initialization has timestamp filtering warnings
During stepper initialization we have a few lines of warnings -> timestamp filtering again (should we just hide these messages?)

#### 2011-08-11, 20:35:48 - Andras Lasso
(In r:552) Fixed #227: Verified the warnings and they are valid (the timestamps are inaccurate and so the item shall be ignored) but it may be normal to happen sometimes. Therefore, modified the logging to just log it as debug information and not as error/warning.
Fixed synchronization start time computation. The frame corresponding to the computed start time was not available anymore in the buffer (due to some inaccuracy in estimating the necessary buffer size). Use just the frames that are actually in the buffer to avoid having this error.
Fixed a couple of other warning messages.

## #231 Refactoring of TrusCalibration and fCal projects
Some refactoring is needed in the TrusCalibration and fCal projects:
* vtkDataCollector reads from file and contains the configuration vtkXMLDataElement. It should be done by the applications (eg. so that VolumeReconstructor does not have to get its configuration from DataCollector)
* vtkDataCollector should have a thinner and more convenient public interface for acquisition
* fCal should be reorganized according to the ticket #192 (see details there)

(In r:940) Re #231: vtkFreehandCalibrationTest changed to use the new calibration (load and segment the tracked frame lists and just add those to the vtkCalibrationController); The baseline had to be changed because now we use all images in the sequence metafiles, not just the specified number (I tested the matching by cropping the result tracked frame lists and adding them to the calibrator, and it gave exactly the same result); UltrasoundImageDimensions was removed from the result according to our discussion with Tomi (that value is not automatically set by the calibrator any more and checking it explicitly does not really make sense);

## #234 Half of ImageCanvas becomes white in iCalBrachy
I don't know how to reproduce it but I submit this ticket to be aware of this issue.

#### 2011-08-10, 21:49:47 - Tamas Heffter
Can it be the iCal phantom STL model? 

#### 2011-08-10, 22:30:20 - Csaba Pinter
I don't think so, because the white part is only on the image canvas, it is not like another object was in the front of it.

I forgot to write here, but several seconds after it happened, the application crashed. Andras told that it looks like a memory allocation issue (he was there, saw it).

#### 2011-08-13, 14:46:12 - Andras Lasso
This problem may be due to failed thread creation:

The vtkImageFlip creates threads for the threaded image algorithm every time in UsImageConverterCommon::ConvertItkImageToVtkImage(const ImageType::Pointer& inFrame, vtkImageData* outFrame) function:
Do you think we need to change this? Any idea? Should we just flip the image by copying the memory? Can you investigate this? 

  // VTK convention is for the image voxel index (0,0,0) to be the lower-left corner of the image, so we need to flip it
  vtkSmartPointer<vtkImageFlip> flipY = vtkSmartPointer<vtkImageFlip>::New(); 
  flipY->SetFilteredAxis(1); 
  flipY->SetInput( importer->GetOutput() ); 
  flipY->Update();

About every 2nd time, when Start button is clicked, the image freezes until cancelled and restarted. Before clicking Start, the image moves as anticipated (if the stepper translation is changed, eht image changes accordingly), but when the user clicks Start, it stops.

It can be the UI refreshing problem. Sometimes, in the progress bar notification event the process request call didn't process QTimer timeout events, therefore the UI won't refresh.

#### 2011-08-16, 15:26:31 - Andras Lasso
I've tried to reproduce the problem by calling AccurateTimer::Delay from 8 threads with different timeout values and there was no thread hangs in 6 hours.

Maybe the thread was not actually hanging (the delay is implemented by suspending the thread until the requested wait time is reached) or the hang is cause by some circular dependency or unlocked synchronization objects.

To be able to continue the investigation please let me know how to reproduce the problem.

Subject: Re: Failed calibration tests since this morning

This was the bug: 
I've reserved 1 double vector, than pus back a double vector (now the size is 2), then get the first vector (which is 0 after constructor): 

// calculate difference between the computed and measured angles
  std::vector< std::vector<double> > diffVector(1);
  std::vector<double> diff; 
  for( int row = 0; row < m; row++ )
  {
    diff.push_back( bVector[row] - aMatrix[row].get(0) * centerOfRotationX - aMatrix[row].get(1) * centerOfRotationY ); 
  }
  diffVector.push_back(diff); 

if ( !meanVector.empty() )
  {
    mean = meanVector[0]; 
  }

It should affect the center of rotation and rotation encoder calibration result.

I don't remember what I changed yesterday (we didn't have internet access after the border, so I could only commit everything together), but as far as I know I've found a bug with the outlier detection, so it could cause the difference. 
It would be great, if you could check the actual calibration result, just to make sure it's good. The thing is, that the ulterius data calibration is the same, so it shouldn't be a big issue.

In the failed test case the center of rotation changed about 2-3mm as a result of outlier rejection.

=> Need to check on a few new data sets if the center of rotation is really improved by the recent code changes. If it is confirmed then the baseline data shall be updated.

Fixed by updating the baseline (the previous baseline was generated with a non-functional center-of-rotation detection algorithm).

## #252 Some tickets have 'Bug:' in the title 
Currently some tickets that refer to bugs contains the 'Bug:' text in the title. Classification of the tickets could be useful, but it should be done consistently.

Probably custom fields would be the most appropriate method. I assume that valid field values can be defined, setting the field can be made mandatory, it can be used for filtering, etc.

Ticket types could be: Bug / Enhancement

Please remove the 'Bug:' tags and store ticker type as a custom field (or in other some similar, structured way).

I created a new Custom Field named 'Issue Type'. It has three possible values now: Bug / Enhancement / Administrative. I modified the issues with 'Bug:' prefix as you suggested.
I also created a Team Filter in the Tickets 'Active by Milestone showing Issue Types' that shows it in the list.
I did not changed the type of the others (most of them are Enhancements, some of them are Admin), but it is a required field so it will be mandatory in the future

## #253 Check and fix all the Read/WriteConfiguration functions to get and use the root XML element
We agreed that the default configuration object that is passed is the root element (reference to the whole XML tree), although is not introduced fully yet, only in the new parts. It can introduce errors, since the programmer assumes that the passed element is (or is not) the root element, but it can be the other way (see rev. 599)
A review is needed throughout the code.

## #254 Create a common widget for setting the image parameters
If we want to set the image parameters (Scaling, ROI), now we have to acquire sample data with TrackedUltrasoundCapturing, open it in ImageJ, measure the parameters and then write it in the configuration file.
We need a widget that does it for us:
* Display realtime image
* Load and display the parameters from the current configuration file
* Enable us to modify the parameters (drag the corners of the ROI, draw to line sections for the horizontal and vertical scaling, define image orientation)
* Save back the results to the config file

## #259 Incorrect segmentation during Freehand Calibration
Segmentation only occurs in the middle of the phantom if the probe is moved up and down very rapidly, and the segmentation is delayed occurring on the frame before the current one. Segmentation occurs normally on the edges of the phantom. If a reflection is seen in the image (ie, you ultrasound part of the plastic) segmentation occurs on the reflection. This started occurring after six successful calibration, they were all recorded during the same session by using the 'reset' button. Fcal and SONIX were both restarted and the segmentation was still not occurring properly. 

#### 2011-08-22, 20:57:20 - Tamas Ungi
I've found two problems that caused this issue:
1. The threads were loose. It should always be checked before calibration, and tightened with pieces of rubber, or rewired if necessary.
2. In the config file, the minimum wire reflection size had to be lowered: MorphologicalOpeningCircleRadiusMm='0.30' from 0.47.

The status icon has some ugly interpolation artifacts around its border and overall it is completely off (it doesn't look like a 3D button at all but more like one edge of the png is zoomed 10x and clipped). The icon is so dark that it's difficult to recognize the color.

@rankin could you please have a look? If it's difficult to make it work on various screen resolutions (normal and hi-DPI) then we can replace it with a flat icon.

## #265 Add support for RF data acquisition, saving, and loading
Video sources already support RF data acquisition, but the code many places assume that the pixel type is 8-bit unsigned. RF data is stored in 16-bit signed pixel format, so it's necessary to add support for this pixel type throughout the library.

## #275 Build error for common widgets in PLUS App
*Hussam and I get the following error when compiling the common widgets project. We are wondering if it is related to ticket #254 (Create a common widget for setting the image parameters).

As a result some of the PLUS App projects do not compile (e.g. TrackedUltrasoundCapturing). Could anyone comment on this please?

I would like to highlight that all of the files in my PlusApp are updated.

Create tester programs for all common widgets. Sikuli can be used to drive the test, in course of which the most functions are used.

It should be done after moving the common widgets to PlusLib (we agreed to move them there, and all the other testers are in PlusLib)

## #279 Implement RF to B-mode conversion filter
Adding the Hilbert transform functionality as an itkImageToImageFilter is storngly recommended for RF data handling. It creates a B-mode image from the RF frame.

#### 2011-09-02, 22:06:09 - Tamas Ungi
I would create a new folder, say 'ImageProcessing' in PlusLib. Anybody any other idea where should this go?

#### 2011-09-06, 03:54:34 - Andras Lasso
Amplio and Pando libraries (part of Ultrasonix SDK) can perform this processing. Pro: they are the same algorithms as used normally for B-mode image computation in the exam software. Con: it's not open source.

Algorithm:
* Envelope detection from IQ sampled RF signal: scaleValue * (min(max(sqrt(sqrt(sqrt( I[i]*I[i] +Q[i]*Q[i] ))), minValue), maxValue) - minValue)
* Envelope detection from real-valued RF signal: using Hilbert transform
* Scan conversion: http://server.elektro.dtu.dk/personal/jaj/31545/exercises/exercise1/programs/

## #283 Temporal calibration crashes when it tries to calibrate on invalid data
When I accidentally click on start temporal calibration (instead of start probe calibration) and do a probe calibration then sometimes the temporal calibration makes fCal crash.

#### 2011-09-06, 04:07:04 - Andras Lasso
Siavash, please upload the latest Ulterius SDK that supports the 5.7.0 exam software to image server (at Queen's Tomi has the Ultrasonix login but he is on vacation for one more week):
server: image.cs.queensu.ca
directory: /data/shared/data/lab.hardware/Ultrasonix/Ultrasonix5.?.?SDK

Then I will upload the SDK to PLTools. If this new SDK version is backward-compatible with the 5.6.x exam softwar then I'll just make it the chosen SDK for Ulterius 5.x. If it's not backward compatible then I'll add an option to let you choose the Ulterius minor version (currently only the major version can be selected, using the PLUS_ULTERIUS_MAJOR_VERSION variable in CMake).

## #285 Hole filling after volume reconstruction doesn't seem to be effective
Normally holes remain in a volume after performing volume reconstruction. A hole filling algorithm was implemented in the reconstructor but it didn't fill any holes. The volume reconstructor was later reworked and the hole filling algorithm was moved into vtkFillHolesInVolume class, but this class was not tested.

Is there a plan to fix this issue in the near future? Registration/segmentation algorithms are very sensitive to changes in the intensity and holes change the local intensity significantly.



#### 2012-02-08, 03:15:06 - Andras Lasso
We expect to have a fix for the current algorithm within a couple of weeks and some advanced algorithms in a few months. See more details at Volume_reconstruction_algorithm.

## #286 Need to test the volume reconstructor with curvilinear probes
The volume reconstructor has been completely reworked and then tested with only linear probes. Need to test if it works correctly with curvilinear probes (fan-shaped cropping region) and maybe need to simplify/fix the fan definition parameters definition.

First of all, this *requires test image acquisition with a tracked curvilinear probe*.

Commenting style of used toolkits:
* QT: Qt-style
* ITK: QT-style (/** \\param  */)
* VTK: own, non-standard style (// Description: )
* OpenIGTLink: mixed QT-style and VTK-style

=> QT style commenting (see http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/docblocks.html) should be used. Added note to the developer's page.

## #288 Inconsistent dll linkage warnings in Vibro
There are many 'Inconsistent dll linkage' build warnings in PlusLib/src/Vibro.
See the dashboard:
http://crunch.cs.queensu.ca/CDash/viewBuildError.php?type=1&buildid=2027

The PlusLib shall not contain any build warnings, because often the warnings indicate real errors. If there are build warnings they also make it difficult to see if new build warnings appear.

Let me (Andras) know if you think that you won't be able to fix it today or you need help with fixing this issue.

(In r:711) Fixed #288: Replaced VIBROLIB_API by the common VTK_EXPORT macro to expose classes to the DLL interface correctly. Removed StdAfx.cxx&h as we don't use precompiled headers in Plus. Added reference to PlusConfigure.h and added vtkPlusCommon as a required lib, as these contain some basic macros (for exporting symbols, logging, timestamping, etc.) that are needed for all Plus library component.

## #289 Serial communication implementation is duplicated in Vibro and BrachyTracking
Basic serial (RS-232) communication is implemented in both the BrachyTracking and in the Vibro library. It's important not to have duplicate code for the same functionality.

Recommended implementation steps:

*Step 1:* Automatic tests should be added for serial communication in Vibro before the rework that would allow us to easily test that there is no regression.

*Step 2:* Serial communication implementation shall be moved from Vibro and Brachytracking go into a common library (Signaling?) and that common library shall be used in both Vibro and Brachytracking.
Affected files:
PlusLib\\src\  racking\\BrachyTracking\\Utils\\SerialLine.cxx 
PlusLib\\src\  racking\\BrachyTracking\\Utils\\SerialLine.h
PlusLib\\src\\Vibro\\SerialBuffer.cxx
PlusLib\\src\\Vibro\\SerialBuffer.h
PlusLib\\src\\Vibro\\SerialCommHelper.cxx

The Vibro Mcdc motor controller code is currently not used by any projects, may work, but probably the code is incomplete.

Let's wait a few months to see if this motor controller code is needed at all. If needed, add tests, clean it up, etc. If not needed, then simply delete it from the repository.

## #293 vibroAudioCardTest1 fails on certain machines
vibroAudioCardTest1 fails on PROSTATE and LIVER PCs.

PROSTATE has no audio output (it has a soundcard but it complains that no speaker or headphones are connected).
Maybe LIVER (Tomi's PC) doesn't have a working sound card?

Possible resolution options:
-set up the sound on PROSTATE and LIVER (plug in a headphone?), and/or
-add a build option (PLUS_USE_AUDIO) to enable/disable audio (and then disable audio on PCs without sound cards)


#### 2011-09-17, 05:36:19 - Andras Lasso
Siavash, please check with Tomi Heffter if he can set up the sound on LIVER and PROSTATE. If he cannot set up the sound (by plugging in a headphone, etc.), then disable the PLUS_USE_AUDIO option on these PCs (you can ask Tomi can change options on LIVER, you can ask me to change options on PROSTATE).

Hi Siavash, 

Unfortunately, I won't be available on Monday, but we can discuss it on Tuesday anytime. 
Probably it's going to be hard to identify the problem, since the latest Nightly test was successful on LIVER, and I'm still waiting for the latest Continuous build result on Prostate. The two errors were different also, does this error sounds familiar for you? 
- On Prostate: [ERROR] [000.001000] Failed to initialize DirectSound, error: -2005401480 [in C:\\Users\\lasso\\devel\\PlusContinuous-bin\\PlusLib\\src\\Vibro\\AudioCard\\DirectSoundInstance.cxx(23)] 
- On Liver: [ERROR] [000.001000] DirectSoundInstance::SetPriority failed because pDirectSound is invalid [in ..\\..\\..\\..\\PlusLib\\src\\Vibro\\AudioCard\\DirectSoundInstance.cxx(30)] 
Cheers,

Hi Tamas,

Since vibroAudioCardTest1 is failing on the Prostate and the Liver, could we please talk on Skype on Monday and try to get it working on those machines?

I am in a meeting with Tamas between 11 and 2 pm (PST). I am free other wise.

Siavash


#### 2011-09-19, 02:18:37 - Andras Lasso
The two errors are the same, I just added some more details to the error logging, that's why the text was different.

LIVER: maybe it works now because you plugged in your headset. You can try to run the tests with and without the headset plugged to confirm this.

PROSTATE: maybe it's enough just to plug in a headphone. It seems that the sound card recognizes that there is no headphone/speakers are plugged in and it refuses play a sound. Tomi, if you could plug in a headphone/earphone then I could try to run the tests remotely (I'm back in Kingston on Friday).

Hi Tomi,

I have a TA session in the afternoon on Tuesday from 2-4 pm (PST). We can meet before that.

Neither of the two errors mean anything to me, but I can ask Hani about it. he was the project manager for IPVE. If you can set a time for Tuesday, I can ask Hani to join us.



#### 2011-09-19, 04:09:41 - Andras Lasso
The errors are logged by our own code, even the file name and line number should be logged. Just check the source code to see what conditions they are logged in.
 

#### 2011-09-19, 04:41:42 - Tamas Heffter
Do you think it could detect an analog headset as well? I can understand the USB headset. Your idea is make sense for me, as you thought I've just plugged in my usb headset on Saturday. But anyway, I'll test it on Tuesday with analog and digital headsets and keep you guys updated. 
Siavash, we can just try it without Hani, because we caught all the errors as Andras said. I'll try to call you before 2pm (PST) over Skype.  

#### 2011-09-19, 05:07:40 - Andras Lasso
I think PROSTATE can detect analog connection of speakers.

Guys, no luck... I've tried the test with/without headset, but worked properly in both cases. I've tried it while listening music, worked fine, however the last two nightly tests were failed on my workstation. 
Displaying the right error message would help to identify the problem: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms898136.aspx

#### 2011-09-20, 19:51:10 - Andras Lasso
Tomi, could you just try to run the vibroAudioCardTest1 manually? Do you hear the sound?
Maybe the audio device is unavailable when you are logged out/screen is locked/access the computer through remote desktop?
Could you try to start BuildAndTest and immediately lock the computer to see if it fails or not?


#### 2011-09-21, 03:07:15 - Siavash Khallaghi
Tomi, I take it that you haven't been able to run it. I am available anytime on Skype if there is anything that I can do to help.

Also could you please send me the description of your soundcard? Maybe your soundcard driver does not support libraries in vibroAudioCardTest1.

#### 2011-09-21, 03:30:55 - Tamas Heffter
I've already tried it with headset, without headset, with another music in the background, from nightly build, running it manually, with locked screen, everything, but couldn't reproduce the error (i could always hear the sound). 

The error code was -2005401590 in the log, which is strange for me, tried to compare with these (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms898136.aspx) but no luck. Should we add the possible error codes to PlusLib\\src\\Vibro\\AudioCard\\DirectSoundInstance.cxx(23)?

My video card is a Realtek High Definition audio (probably integrated to the motherboard). 


#### 2011-09-21, 03:33:22 - Tamas Heffter
On PROSTATE, most of the time the error code was -2005401480, which is different from HEART. 

#### 2011-09-21, 03:37:58 - Siavash Khallaghi
Tomi, I think th enumber that you see in the error is not the error code. I think it is the variable 'hr' that has not been initialized properly and that is the reason why you get a different number on each machine.

#### 2011-09-21, 03:38:17 - Tamas Heffter
Siavash, the following modification introduced the error first time in the continuous build, is it possible that it's not compatible with Windows XP (however, Andras has XP on BLADDER, but with no problem, and also PROSTATE is Win7)? 

dsound.h Revision: 757 by siavashk
Replaced dsound.h and dsound.lib files from Hani's IPVE (Inverse Problem in Vibro Elastography) with corresponding versions from Microsoft SDK version 7.0A. The path for these files on my machine was under: C:Program FilesMicrosoft SDKsWindows\u000B7.0AInclude C:Program FilesMicrosoft DirectX SDK (February 2010)Lib Also I think the previous commited version of dsound.lib was the same as this version.

#### 2011-09-21, 03:42:31 - Tamas Heffter
I think this is the init (there is no crash or anything, so that's a return value of the function): 
HRESULT hr=::DirectSoundCreate(NULL, &pDirectSound, NULL); 

But just in case, can you initialize it to 0 before the call?  

#### 2011-09-21, 04:27:37 - Andras Lasso
This initialization is completely OK, it's the shortest and simplest:
HRESULT hr=::DirectSoundCreate(NULL, &pDirectSound, NULL);

This is correct as well, but it is unnecessary to initialize the variable to 0 then assign another value:
HRESULT hr=0;
hr=::DirectSoundCreate(NULL, &pDirectSound, NULL);

You only need to initialize the variable if you don't initialize it with a return value, such as:
HRESULT hr=0; // need to initialize hr here because maybe SomeFunction will not set its value
SomeFunction(1, 2, 3, &hr);

The test fails if there is no audiocard available. This is found to be caused by either of these:
* there is no usable audio device available (PROSTATE requires a headphone plugged in)
* the audio device is blocked (when a user logs off from remote desktop then the audio card becomes blocked)

Solution:
* Make sure that there is an available audio device in all test PCs
* Don't use Microsoft's remote desktop (Microsoft Terminal Server Client), but you use logmein instead. If you logged in with Microsoft remote desktop then make sure to log in locally before runnning tests (logging in locally unblocks the audio device)

## #294 Latest fCal freezes after starting probe calibration 
Workaround:
*Option A: Use the latest Plus version, but you won't see the image you are acquiring, only on the ultrasound machine. The application will only show the results when the calibration is ready.
*Option B: Use the latest released Plus binary package to do the calibration and get the calibration parameters from the resulting XML file.
*Option C: Capture a short sequence using TrackedUltrasoundCapturing and send to Csaba, he'll create a config file that works with an earlier Plus release.

ETA of the fix: September 30

#### 2011-09-19, 14:23:38 - Csaba Pinter
It works, only the UI doesn't refresh. I postponed doing it after we consolidate the calibration module, because the acquisition will be done by the application layer, not the calibration algorithm classes. Solving the UI refresh problem would be a major hack, which we would undo after 2 weeks anyway.
In the meantime, we should use the stable 1.2.2 release for calibration. As a matter of fact, I think it would be a reasonable general rule to always use the latest released version instead of the trunk, because the trunk is most likely less stable than the last release.

Does 1.2.2 have the segmentation parameter setting graphical widget?

#### 2011-09-19, 15:30:13 - Csaba Pinter
No, unfortunately it doesn't, but if you capture a short sequence using TrackedUltrasoundCapturing and send to me, I can set it up for you.
Or you can use the latest to set the parameters and do the calibration with the released.
Or you can use the latest for everything, but you won't see the image you are acquiring, only on the ultrasound machine (which is the other laptop for the Terason). The application will only show the results when the calibration is ready.

I would suggest the first or the second solution. Sorry for the inconvenience.

#### 2011-09-19, 22:51:01 - Andras Lasso
There hasn't been rules about this until now and the user/developer base of Plus is quickly growing, so it's perfectly normal that we have these issues. Let's see how should we handle this in the future and apply that to this case.

Plus 'users' don't just use binary releases but they directly add their stuff to the trunk to minimize non-trivial merges and get latest developments as soon as possible. In this environment I think we should not introduce any regressions intentionally.

If there is any regression that cannot be fixed quickly (within a day?) and can impact anybody's work then we should let the developers know about it:
-Create a ticket
-Set its priority to 'highest'
-Describe workaround
-Describe estimated time of the fix

I update this issue accordingly. Csaba, please add the estimated time of arrival of the fix.

Let me know if you have any comments or other suggestions.

I agree with Andras' suggestion.

I didn't do the quick&dirty fix right away, because I would have introduced another thing that needed to be fixed, as we are in the middle of a major architectural change (hopefully the last big one that is needed).

There are two possibilities:
- I do the q&d fix tomorrow (shouldn't take longer than a couple of hours)
- The issue is decently fixed when the architectural change is done (I think the September 30 esimation is OK), but we have to live with this bug in the next two weeks (see workarounds).

It is good for me either way.

Never commit anything that intentionally breaks the dashboard. Update the data, test the code, etc. before committing. If you already committed and there are failing tests then fixing that should be the highest priority.

If you cannot do that within a few hours then handle it as a regression (highest priority ticket, description of workaround - if applicable, estimated time of arrival for the fix).

I wouldn't think it's a good idea. It could introduce new errors, if we don't have a true baseline. There can be bugs in the new code, and if I immediately change the baseline we won't find it easily, nobody will be informed about the changes. I think we should avoid the baseline changes, except we have a good reason for that with code review. In my opinion it's better to have failed tests for one day (or until other can verify the needs) than add more bugs and hide it under the hood.

Regardless, I'll do it today evening :-)

If you think that the baseline is good and the code is wrong then of course you have to fix the code.

(In r:785) re #297: WIP Separate stepper calibration algorithms
- Baseline updated according to the new algorithm result


#### 2011-09-22, 01:14:15 - Tamas Heffter
That's the whole point. This was an algorithmic change, not just a code optimization, so basically I cannot prove that it's good or not - so still need a review. 

#### 2011-09-22, 17:15:22 - Tamas Heffter
(In r:790) re #297: WIP Separate stepper calibration algorithms
- IMAGE_DATA_TYPE enum moved to PlusCommon
- Added IMAGE_DATA_TYPE to vtkTranslAxisCalibAlgo to identify the input data

#### 2011-09-22, 22:34:15 - Tamas Heffter
(In r:792) re #297: WIP Separate stepper calibration algorithms
Added vtkTranslAxisCalibAlgoTest and fixed vtkTranslAxisCalibAlgo

#### 2011-09-24, 03:04:04 - Tamas Heffter
(In r:795) re #297: WIP Separate stepper calibration algorithms

#### 2011-09-24, 03:32:24 - Tamas Heffter
(In r:796) re #297: WIP Separate stepper calibration algorithms
Report generation failed on continuous build, need more investigation. Until that removed from test. 

#### 2011-09-24, 14:20:34 - Tamas Heffter
(In r:797) re #297: WIP Separate stepper calibration algorithms
- Changed log level to trace in order to find out the problem with report generation on PROSTATE
- Added trace messages to all function in vtkGnuplotExecuter and vtkHTMLGenerator

#### 2011-09-24, 16:32:24 - Tamas Heffter
(In r:798) re #297: WIP Separate stepper calibration algorithms
- Moved GetStepperEncoderValues to vtkBrachyTracker
- Changed back trace level to info for vtkTranslAxisCalibAlgoTests 
- replaced = ''; in the whole code with:
- NULL, if it's a char* and you get/set it with VTK macros (you can then set the pointer to an empty string if you want to avoid having a NULL pointer: this->Something=NULL; SetSomething(''); )
- nothing, if it's a std::string constructor (std::string something = ''; is unnecessary, you can always safely use std::string something;)
- clear(), if it's a std::string clearing (instead of something = ''; using something.clear() is more elegant and efficient)

#### 2011-09-24, 17:10:45 - Tamas Heffter
(In r:800) re #297: WIP Separate stepper calibration algorithms

The original goal (making it a vtk object) is not reasonably achievable since in tons of places, a TrackedFrame is created on the stack, which cannot be done with a vtkObject

## #300 Tap and wire the iCalB 1.0 phantom


#### 2011-09-30, 13:50:15 - Thomas Kuiran Chen
Got a little complication here: the tap holes have unresolved support materials left from the printing (HMRC did not properly resolve it this time).  This prevented the tap screw to go deeper during tapping.  I have returned the phantom to HMRC and they will put it in a acid bath to complete resolve the residuals.  - Thomas

SegmentationParameters is the only element in USCalibration now (except an empty ProbeCalibration element that is only used to be able to write the results in but it can be created easily if it is not there).

USCalibration and CalibrationController should be removed, so SegmentationParameter element is right under root.
Saving the result needs further discussion (related to #351 and #352)

## #303 Saved synchronized data should be possible to play back
Now, SavedDataset mode in Tracker and VideoSource works only if the two buffers were separately saved. The playback of saved synchronized data should also be made possible for demo preparation, and maybe also for testing components independently from synchronization.

#### 2011-09-29, 12:54:51 - Andras Lasso
'works only if the two buffers were separately saved' => what is the error you get?
how to reproduce (which exe, xml, data file)?

#### 2011-09-29, 15:41:42 - Tamas Ungi
For e.g. (I think this is the only example right now) vtkOpenIGTLinkBroadcasterTest1 in vtkDataCollection/Testing needs a video buffer and a tracker buffer now. If you provide it with an .mha file recorded with TrackedUltrasoundCapturing, it cannot play back and broadcast this recorded procedure.
Example tracked frame list buffer:
s:\\images\\LiveUltrasound\\2011-09-27_ProstateUS\\ProstatePhantom_ECProbe_SonixGPS_Short.mha
(for those who have access to the Queen's image server)
 
When it tries to read the video buffer and the tracker buffer, it fails with error Unable to read Status field of frame.... There is no Status field in the recorded file.
 
This test has to be rewritten to read just one tracked frame list buffer from file. Not use separate tracker and video source.
I think more tests should be added to Plus using recorded tracked frame lists. It can test features independently from synchronization.

## #306 Add test for calibration with beam profiling


#### 2011-10-06, 22:22:53 - Csaba Pinter
(In r:899) Fixed #304: Calibration now uses PlusMath instead of TrusCalibrationCommon/LinearLeastSquares; TrusCalibrationCommon project deleted (not used any more); baselines updated (results are slightly different due to the new outlier filtering); Beamwidth weights are applied the same way, but not tested because there is no test yet for it (see #306)

Beamwidth compensation will not be re-introduced in the foreseeable future, as it adds complexity to the calibration and it's unclear if there is any benefit (beamwidth effects seem to be noticable if extreme imaging settings are used).

In Plus and PlusApp:
* Check all vtkImageFlip instances and remove them, update camera positions
* Check all vtkImageData usage, update the camera and remove flips
* Remove PlusVideoFrame::CopyToVtkImage
* Remove all VTK IO classes, use ITK IO classes instead 
* Add to developer's guide: Don't use VTK IO classes for reading/writing image data (or flip right after reading or right before writing). VTK image and ITK image use the same memory layout

## #308 Need to show the wire numbers in fCal
The current wire segmentation algorithm determines the wire positions based on the distance from the image origin, therefore it matters how we hold the probe (if we rotate it by 180deg around its long axis).

Need to show the wire numbers in fCal (at least in the segmentation parameter dialog) and show a help message:
* check if the line numbers are consistent with the CAD model (show a sketch to explain it or describe exactly which side of the phantom the marked axis should point to)
* check if the MF axes are correctly shown (by touching the marked side of the transducer and that the probe surface is near the MF axis origin)

#### 2011-09-28, 14:08:13 - Andras Lasso
Some more explanation why it's not enough to just pay attention to the image orientation value setting:

You can only determine the correct image orientation if you define the marked side and
1. Verify that the marked side is consistent with the image orientation value.
2. The marked side of the probe is closer to the left side of the phantom. This is trivial with the stepper and the optical tracker (as you cannot rotate the probe by 180deg in these cases), but with the EM tracker it's easy to hold the probe incorrectly.

If you make a double error (incorrectly set the image orientation value and incorrectly position the probe) then you can get a small calibration error, but you can run into troubles later on (when visualizing, reconstructing the results, etc.)

To eliminate the 2. check we would need to add an additional wire, which could be detected automatically or by the user to resolve the ambiguity.

## #309 Segmentation algorithm fails to detect pattern from correctly identified fiducial candidates
When the endocavity probe is used the segmentation works only if the ROI is set to a small region only. The segmentation algo cannot segment those clear images with candidates on the real wires. 

There can be problem with just the visualization and/or the algorithm itself. If Csaba can create a standalone app that uses the segparam setting widget with a real-time or saved data source then Andras could investigate the issue.

I am not sure which phantom was used when this bug occurred, but if it was the fCal phantom with the blue wires (I think it is the most probable), then this can be the same issue that is described in #332.

Andras (as you submitted this ticket), please confirm.

#### 2011-10-19, 19:16:12 - Andras Lasso
It was the fCal phantom with the blue wires, so probably it's the same problem as #332.

I agree, the package should be installed in somewhere in the user home. In the long term (if we don't expect any significant config file changes anymore) then we may consider installing Plus executables under program files and config files in the user home.

- read STL file name and transform name from xml and display it in a QVTKWidget by setting the UserTransform of the actor (get the transform from DataCollector)
- read image transform name from xml and display image actor in a QVTKWidget by setting the UserTransform of the actor (get the transform from DataCollector and the image from DataCollector->GetOutput() )
- read axis transform name from xml and display axis actor in a QVTKWidget by setting the UserTransform of the actor (get the transform from DataCollector)

## #317 Support reading and writing of large metafiles
We need a new a new metafile writer/reader, which doesn't need extra memory for saving, faster than the current one, can write files >4GB, and uses exactly the same metaimage format.

Step 2: Add support for frame-by-frame reading/writing. This will allow writing a file while recording it, and reading/processing a file without reading the whole file into memory

#### 2011-10-11, 20:32:13 - Tamas Heffter
Csaba, can we somehow force the PlusLib to read the vtkPlusConfig::ReadApplicationConfiguration() from one of the core libraries? 
It would be great if we would have access to the application data (like output directory in this specific case) before we actually call vtkPlusConfig::SetProgramPath(const char* aProgramDirectory).

## #326 Volume reconstructor crash
Crash in vtkPasteSliceIntoVolume::InsertSliceThreadFunction function. First the scalar types do not match then there is a crash around the garbage collection (no decent call stack is present so I could only guess).

#### 2011-10-12, 18:02:44 - Andras Lasso
I could have a look at the issue. Could you describe how to reproduce the problem (which device set to use, what steps to do...)?

#### 2011-10-12, 18:09:02 - Csaba Pinter
First I used fCal (the just re-enabled Volume reconstruction toolbox), but then I tried the command-line application, and it did the same thing. In the attached log, you can see what errors I got before the crash.
The device set (from which only the VolumeReconstruction element matters in this case) I used was the PlusConfiguration_SavedDataset_fCal_1.0.xml, and the image was \\\\image\\shared_data\\images\\fCAL\\2011-07-22_fCal_CalibrationTestDataset\\fCal_20110722_Short.mha

OK, then I don't investigate this issue. The code shall not crash, but just return with failure if conifguration options are missing or incorrect.

## #329 Segmentation algorithm datasets: some baseline results are incorrect.
The baseline results provide a list of segmented dots which sometimes do not make sense, for example in:

USTC_FrameGrabber_ProbeRotationData.mha

Some frames are, according to the baseline, successfully segmented while the results are dots on the far right side of the image, not in the field of view of the probe but on the parameters of the ultrasound system (Gain, depth, etc.).

This should not be considered 'Success' even if the algorithm found dots that match the requirements.

The Regions of Interest should be defined carefully to avoid such false positive results. Maybe the segmentation part of the algorithm should be more restrictive to avoid segmenting the letters as fiducial candidates.

This is an issue when truing to upgrade the algorithm, as once you compare to the baseline, even if the new results are correct, the comparison to the baseline fails.

## #331 Change vtk version to the latest 5.10.0
The current vtk 5.6.1 vtk release has a compilation error at vtk\\Graphics\\vtkYoungsMaterialInterface.cxx line 2921
For more information: http://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=10777&history=1

It really nothing (need to hit an enter), but unfortunately because this compilation error the whole plus build fails and the previous ticket status is expired. 
I would suggest to move to the latest official vtk release as soon as we can. 

#### 2011-10-14, 20:55:20 - Tamas Heffter
Andras, what do you think? Should we give it a try? 

#### 2011-10-14, 21:13:48 - Andras Lasso
Is this VTK 5.6 compilation issue a new problem? I've never experienced this.

I don't see a big risk in moving to VTK 5.8 as we don't use any advanced VTK features or extensions.

At some point we should do it anyway, so if we are not time constrained (I don't know about any pressing deadline) and have enought time for testing then I think we can do it now.

#### 2011-10-14, 21:24:12 - Tamas Heffter
Actually we found this error a couple of hours ago on a clean machine when we started to build Plus on Thomas' notebook. It was surprising me too, because I've tried to check the modification but on that file with this tag the last modification was around 2009 or 2010 if I remember well (unfortunately I couldn't really find out from GIT). So I don;t really understand how is that possible that we didn't get this error. 
On my PC and Csaba's PC the same file is good, however I didn't run the PlusBuild this week. 

The change wouldn't take too much time, just one line change in the PlusBuild. 

#### 2011-10-14, 22:11:03 - Andras Lasso
Very strange. Nobody has complained about it.

Changing the tag is easy, but the testing that everything still works well requires some work.

#### 2011-10-16, 20:58:47 - Andras Lasso
I've removed VTK and rebuilt it on BLADDER and it worked fine. It was either a temporary problem with the VTK repository or specific to Thomas' PC.

#### 2011-10-16, 23:15:10 - Tamas Heffter
That's strange, we had this problem twice on his machine (we've also deleted it), and also there was a ticket about his problem. 
Can you check the following line (it looked like this on his PC): 
vtk\\Graphics\\vtkYoungsMaterialInterface.cxx line 2921 or 2920 
// construction de la fonction cubique par morceau du volume tronqu? for(int i=0;i<nt;i++)

#### 2011-10-17, 00:34:07 - Andras Lasso
OK, I understand then. Thomas uses Chinese version of Windows/MSVC/SVN/etc which interprets some extended ASCII characters as multi-byte characters (see http://vtk.1045678.n5.nabble.com/Misinterpretation-of-a-non-ascii-character-by-MSVC-td1252227.html).

We need to move to VTK 5.8 sooner or later anyway, so if we don't have any critical deadline soon (I don't know about one), then we can move now.

#### 2011-10-17, 00:51:05 - Thomas Kuiran Chen
This is very interesting, Andras. How did you find out the problem? My laptop has Chinese enabled as the system locale.  Will v5.8 have a better Chinese compatibility?


#### 2011-10-17, 02:11:31 - Andras Lasso
I think in 5.8 the French comment with the accented e character is removed, so it must be fully Asian compatible.

## #332 Segmentation fails with new fCal phantom wiring
It probably fails due to the new (blue) wire, because it does not have a constant shape on the images because it is woven.
The fishing line we had in it before was fine from this point of view, but it had the problem that it provided a decent image when the probe was held exactly vertical.
Something else should be found that eliminates both problems.

First an image sequence is needed to be taken so that we can prove this theory about the blue wire.

#### 2011-10-21, 15:07:33 - Csaba Pinter

Either that or as the wires get old their image becomes better (because of the deposited scale). I'm thinking of re-wiring the first phantom and try again.

#### 2011-11-07, 21:13:37 - Csaba Pinter
I did the re-wiring with the blue vowen line and it worked fine.

After we decided to use tracked frames and tracked frame list as an input for all algorithms it would be good if we could move the tracked frame related classes to a new dll to have a cleaner design. 
Currently the tracking dll is depends on the image acquisition (to be able to use the saved dataset) and almost every lib to image acquisition.

## #334 Simplify calibration report generation
After the refactoring has been completed (the calibration algorithm class gets TrackedFrameList as input and gives a matrix and the error report as output, and the obsolete functions have been removed), the report generation should be simplified.
Now the report uses a vast number of strange member variables (like mValidationPositionsNWire1InUSProbeFrame for wire 1,3,4 and 6, and some analysis vectors like PointReconstructionErrorAnalysisVector, that instead of real vector elements, it contains independent numbers), and also gives unnecessary data. We should consolidate this.

## #336 Improve NDI tracker support
There is code in PlusLib to support tracking with NDI Polaris and Aurora trackers, but it's not complete. At least the configuration parameter reading from XML (the ReadConfiguration(vtkXMLDataElement* config)) should be implemented. The vtkNDICertusTracker and maybe the vtkBrachyTracker can serve as examples.

The DiagDataCollection (PlusApp\\DiagnosticTools\\DiagDataCollection.cxx) application can be used to collect data and analyze the results (achieved frame rate, jitter, etc.).

*Elvis Chen reported on March 12, 2012:*

For the past few days we have been trying to calibrate our Ultrasonix linear probe with NDI Aurora using fCal.  The tracking information we got from PLUS was very unstable.  For example, if I place a sensor stationary on the table, and wave an US probe with another sensor attached, the reading for the stationary sensor jumps around by, I would say, >5mm at least.

At first, I thought this was caused by the metal inside the US probe.
However, if I repeat the same experiment using NDI's toolbox (which is similar to cube.exe for Ascension), the reading were perfectly fine.

this is repeatable.


#### 2012-03-12, 18:31:31 - Andras Lasso
A few ideas:
* We don't invent any measurement numbers in Plus for the transformation matrices, so if there is any difference in the raw transformation matrices then it is most likely due to using different noise filtering parameters in the NDI toolbox / Plus. It may be possible that the parameters are determined automatically from the frame rate, so it could make sense to test the behavior with different frame rates. Do you know how can we get/set the filtering parameters for NDI trackers?
* When you acquire synchronized image/tracking data then SLERP interpolation is applied to the rotation part of the transformation matrix and simple linear interpolation applied to the translation part. In case of a significantly perturbed pose measurement the result of this interpolation might be noticeable. We can check the difference between interpolated/non-interpolated results to see if we need a different interpolation method.
* Was the behavior of your old synchrograb or other tracker implementation more similar to Plus or more similar to the NDI toolbox? Is the NDI toolbox source code available? You could compare the source code of these implementations to see if there is anything that could explain the different behavior.


#### 2012-03-12, 19:22:37 - Elvis Chen
I don't think there is way to get/set filtering parameters for NDI tracking systems.  Did not see anything on their API.

I used 2 different programs to get the raw transforms from NDI Aurora.  One is the NDI's toolbox software, similar to cubes.exe for Ascension.  The other is AIGS library from David Gobbi.  AIGS and PLUS shares the same tracking code.

when tracking using NDI's toolbox and AIGS, the raw transforms behaves pretty well.  The number of course fluctuates a bit, but they are all sub-millimeters.  Inside of PLUS though, the fluctuation becomes >5mm.  Since PLUS and AIGS are basically the same code, I can only conclude it is caused by the modification (interpolation) PLUS made on top of the raw transforms.

Is there a way to turn off interpolation and used the closest raw transform inside PLUS instead?   

#### 2012-03-12, 20:16:31 - Andras Lasso
Currently there is no API to disable interpolation, but you can easily disable it by a simple change in the code. In PlusLib\\src\  racking\\vtkTrackerBuffer.cxx change the implementation to just return with the closest raw item:

ItemStatus vtkTrackerBuffer::GetInterpolatedTrackerBufferItemFromTime( double time, TrackerBufferItem* bufferItem)
{
 return GetTrackerBufferItemFromClosestTime(time, bufferItem);
}


#### 2012-03-13, 13:12:05 - Andras Lasso
Was the tool calibrated in NDI toolbox, AIGS, and Plus? Did you compare the tooltip or the sensor positions? If the sensor is far from the tooltip then the error in the calibrated tooltip's position is much higher than the error in the sensor's position.

#### 2012-03-13, 13:50:27 - Elvis Chen
we are just looking at the sensor position.  The tool is pre-calibrated by the manufacturer and programmed into the ROM file.

#### 2012-03-30, 19:23:12 - Andras Lasso
Todo for Elvis:
* compare the implementations in Plus and AIGS to see if there is any significant difference
* send the description for how to reproduce it then the Queen’s team will try to follow it to see if it’s specific to that particular device or it’s a generic problem


#### 2012-04-10, 21:07:10 - Elvis Chen
(In r:1605) re #336: added additional baud rate for NDI.  The new USB interface supports 921600.

#### 2012-04-11, 17:50:25 - Elvis Chen
The version of vtkTrackerTool in PLUS is quite different than the one in AIGS.  Notable differences includes the missing of calibration matrix, and the Update() funcation call (available in AIGS but not PLUS).

Have them been refactored into other classes?  

#### 2012-04-11, 18:15:01 - Andras Lasso
Having something like a 'calibration matrix' in the tracker was a really bad idea:
* There was no way to tell if the tool was calibrated or not, when you changed the calibration matrix all you saw was a suddenly change in the received transformation matrices. We could have propagated a 'calibrated' flag with each transformation matrix, but it would have been too complicated.
* There is no such thing as a 'calibration matrix' (there are several transformation matrices that makes a system calibrated), therefore it does not make sense to apply a few transforms inside the tracker and add some more elsewhere, it just makes things very complicated.
* 'CalibrationMatrix' is a very bad name that shall never be used. A transform shall be always specified by the name of the 'to' and 'from' coordinate systems that it transforms between.

We removed the calibration matrix from the tracker class and moved all transformation composition into the transform repository.

The tracker class had many other limitations and some bugs (e.g., incorrect timestamp filtering), so I would suggest to not use the old implementation (the AIGS version).

#### 2012-04-11, 18:42:06 - Elvis Chen
I understand the part about calibration matrix.  What about the actual Update() function that updates the tracking transformation?  Where has that been moved to?

The code snip from AIGS is:


//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// the update copies the latest matrix from the buffer
void vtkTrackerTool::Update()
{
  this->Buffer->Lock();

  // only update this if the time stamp has changed.
  if( this->Buffer->GetTimeStamp(0) > this->TimeStamp )
  {
    this->Flags = this->Buffer->GetFlags(0);

    if ((this->Flags & (TR_MISSING | TR_OUT_OF_VIEW))  == 0)
    {
      this->Buffer->GetMatrix(this->TempMatrix, 0);
      this->Transform->SetMatrix(this->TempMatrix);
    }

    this->TimeStamp = this->Buffer->GetTimeStamp(0);
    this->Modified();
  }
  this->Buffer->Unlock();

  // move the modified into the if structure above.
  // i.e. only mark as modified if we actually modify it.
  //this->Modified();
}


#### 2012-04-11, 18:58:16 - Elvis Chen
also, I'm not working on David Gobbi's version of AIGS.  Andrew Wiles (NDI) has forked it and fixed many problems you have mentioned.  What I am trying to do is to see the improvements/fixes that Andrew made make their way into PLUS, assuming these problems have not been addressed by PLUS already. 

One additional note:  the NDI aurora is guaranteed to track at 40Hz if the aurora has the new firmware (version 11, I believe), regardless the number of tools used.  Thew new USB interface (version 2 of the SCU) also support higher baud rate.  These are what I am trying to incorporate into PLUS.  As you mentioned, the NDI support in PLUS is based on some very old codes. 

#### 2012-04-11, 19:10:53 - Andras Lasso
It's great if you can integrate Andrew's improvements and the higher baud rate. The current timestamp filtering method assumes that the sampling rate is constant, so if the sampling rate is guaranteed to be actually constant then the timestamping will be perfect.

The tracking data is collected and added to the buffer (by calling the ToolTimeStampedUpdate method) in the InternalUpdate method. I think this method corresponds to the Update method in the previous implementation.

Timestamping of the imaging on Ultrasonix devices are quite robust, so you can check the accuracy of the timestamping by performing temporal calibration and plotting the results (it's all available in fCal, see https://www.assembla.com/spaces/plus/wiki/Temporal_Calibration).

## #338 Add fCal sample images to the repository for testing
Currently it's quite difficult to test fCal probe calibration, because there is no configuration files that are readily usable (there are some almost usable config files, but the filename is empty).

Suggested solution:
-During the porject configuration step generate a PlusConig.xml file in the binary directory that contains a link to the _image directory_.
-Change the saved dataset source that if relative path (or just a simple file name) is specified then it is interpreted relative to the specified _image directory_ (e.g., if a filename is specified then search for it in the _image directory_ ).

ImageDirectory should be renamed to SavedDataHomeDirectory, because it is used only for those in course of testing, so it is more expressive.

## #340 Nightly tests for NSIS packaging
There are three main things that we could test for package generation:
* Package generation was successful (there are no missing files)
* Package generating automation (generate package every time we run nightly tests)
* Check that there is no missing dlls (all binaries could run from the package bin folder)

## #341 Common python functions for Sikuli into separate file
Functions (or code snippets that can be moved to a separate function) that are used for the automated Sikuli GUI tests should be moved in another python module that can be imported by all tests.

Results so far:
* Including an external python file:
sys.path.append('d:/devel/Plus-bin/PlusApp/scipts')

## #343 Sikuli tests cannot run on locked computer
The PlusApp automated GUI nightly tests keep failing because the computers that try to run them are locked, and the current Sikuli version (1.0rc3) needs the scripted objects to be actually visible on the screen.

In the forums they advise to have a script that unlocks the cmputer remotely when it is needed, but I don't think it to be a good solution.

(In r:1570) Re #346: Two separate tracked frame lists are used for temporal calibration in order to avoid interpolation

#### 2012-03-24, 23:22:43 - Andras Lasso
The acceptable accuracy is determined by two factors:
# Timestamping accuracy. The resolution of our timestamps is 1ms now (we use a multimedia timer that is called in every ms and we use that counter for measuring time). Therefore, we definitely cannot have a better accuracy than 1ms. Probably the average absolute error is about 1-2ms.
# Maximum speed of tool motion. If there is a non-compensated time lag then it causes spatial error for moving tools. The magnitude of required targeting accuracy is about 1-3mm for most applications (the total system error). If we want to make sure that the temporal calibration’s contribution to this error is negligible then the error should be about one magnitude smaller, about 0.1-0.3mm. For freehand motion the maximum translation is about 100mm/sec, which would mean about max. 1-3ms temporal calibration error. Unfortunately, rotating motion can result in higher position error: with a maximum rotation of 90deg/sec and 100m marker-to-ROI distance leads to about 200mm/sec error, which would mean 0.5-1.5ms maximum acceptable temporal calibration error.

So, it seems that with the current setup we cannot reduce the temporal error induced spatial error to a negligible level. However, something like <3ms error in 95% of the cases would be an acceptable level - if we achieved this then we could stop further investigation. We may also stop the investigation (close the ticket) if we find a higher error, but we don't see any strange outliers or trends in the results.

(In r:1886|plus:1886) re #346: The computation of the tracker position metric for any given tracker position is dependent on the tracker position of all considered frames. This is in contrast to the video position metric which can be derived from a single, isolated US image without consideration of other images; the dependency of the tracker position metric on other multiple tracker positions arises from the principal axis (onto which the tracker positions are projected), which is computed using all the considered tracker positions. Previously, the principal axis was computed using all the (valid) tracker frames in the buffer; this caused (sometimes erroneous) tracker positions outside of the common time range (i.e. the time range shared with the video buffer data) to have the potential to skew the principal axis and thus the tracker position metric. The code has now been updated so that only those tracker frames in the shared time range are to calculate the principal axis. This change seems to have significantly improved the match between the aligned tracker and video metrics on certain recordings. 

A bug with the switch-case statements for choosing the normalization type (amplitude or standard deviation) has also been fixed by adding 'break' statements.

To eliminate this redundancy, the subtraction of the mean has been removed in the computation of the (non-normalized) probe position metric. Some debugging code has also been removed.

(In r:1983|plus:1983) re #346: The old method for resampling--through linear interpolation--the image and tracker position metrics has been replaced with the interpolation functionality provided by vtkPiecewiseFunction. Currently the smoothness and midpoint parameters of the control (i.e. measured/knot) points are set to 0 and 0.5 respectively; this setting provides linear interpolation between the control points. Other settings of these parameters will provide other types of interpolation. The new interpolation technique has been tested on 10 temporal calibration sequences(S:\\data\  emporalTrackedUSCalibration\\SPIE_DATA\awData\\SensitivityStudy\\FrequencyPerturbations\\10.0M) and gives no difference in the calculated offset when compared to the previous linear interpolation method. Additionally, there was no perceivable difference in the computation time between the two methods. The new method is desirable because (1) it provides a simpler interface for the interpolation, and (2) it will facilitate the testing of different interpolation techniques (beyond linear interpolation).

#### 2012-10-12, 02:46:54 - Eric Moult
(In r:2166|plus:2166) re #346: In the previous version of the algorithm, both the tracker and video position signals were resampled at an equal sampling rate. The two sampled signals were then correlated by sliding one signal over top of the other signal, one index at a time. In this version of the algorithm, for each time-offset investigated during the correlation process, the tracker signal is resampled at the video position time-stamps. We interpolate the tracker position signal at the video position time-stamps, and not vice-versa, because the tracker data is generally acquired at a higher frequency (i.e. is more dense) than the image data (i.e. is less dense). This modification was originally made in an attempt to limit the influence that some of the less well sampled regions of the video signal (particularly around the peaks of the signal, where the probe motion changes direction) have on the correlation result (in particular, we wanted to tighten up the variances for data collected at 5Mhz probe frequency). Comparing the results of the new code and old code, the 20 baseline sequences (i.e. sequences with baseline parameters) yielded:

OLD CODE: mean tracker lag= 58.7 (std = 3.2)
NEW CODE: mean tracker lag= 59.6 (std = 3.2)

and the 10 sequences with the probe frequency at 5MHz (which were the sequences that motivated this endeavor):

OLD CODE: mean tracker lag= 90.9 (std = 10.4)
NEW CODE: mean tracker lag= 91.8 (std = 10.6)

So, unfortunately, the change in resampling technique has not reduced variances. However, it is probably a more sound technique on the whole.

#### 2012-10-12, 12:11:10 - Csaba Pinter
Sounds great, Eric!
The point is not to reduce the lags but to measure them correctly, so don't worry about the increase

#### 2012-10-12, 22:10:31 - Andras Lasso
The computation time went from 23 to 240 seconds. This is very significant change (10x). It seems that the InterpolatePositionMetrics is slow (takes about 40msec), and executed thousands of times. I think the main problem is that the tracker position metric is interpolated for every time offset, while it should be enough to create the piecewise function only once.
@EricMoult: When would you have time to work on this?

status: changed from "Fixed" to "Accepted"

#### 2012-10-12, 22:30:22 - Eric Moult
Yes--you are correct that I re-create the piecewise function for each time offset and could get away with only creating the piecewise function once. However, I will still have to interpolate for each time-offset because for each time-offset the video position signal will be aligned differently with respect to the tracker signal. 

I will fix the code so that the piecewise function is only created once--hopefully this solves the problem. I will do this tonight.

Eric.

#### 2012-10-12, 22:44:14 - Andras Lasso
Yes, you still have to interpolate, but hopefully if the piecewise function is created only once then the speed will be OK.

(In r:2177|plus:2177) re #346: The vtkPiecewiseFunction that holds the tracker position signal (and that is used to interpolate the tracker position at the video position timestamps) is now only constructed once, not every time a time-offset is tested during the correlation process (as it was previously). This change was motivated by the increased running time of the last commit of this algorithm; this change has substantially reduced the problem:

Previous Time: 240 secs
New Time: 40 secs

@lassoan: Is 40 seconds still too lengthy? If it is, perhaps we could do a varying resolution search for the best time offset (i.e. start off with a coarse resolution and move towards a fine resolution). Thoughts?

#### 2012-10-13, 10:54:09 - Andras Lasso
40s is much better, but I would say the target would be max 10 sec. The variable step size search is a good idea. We could do a full range search with a step size that is roughly matches the video frame period (estimated from last-first timestamp / number of frames), then search in a range of +/-5 frame period with the finest (1ms) step size.

#### 2012-10-17, 14:42:50 - Andras Lasso
I'll implement this varying step size approach. @EricMoult:Don't modify the temporal calibration algo code until I commit my changes.

(In r:2186|plus:2186) re #346: Implemented variable step size for the optimum match search in the temporal calibration algorithm. First the optimization is performed with a course step size (which matches the video frame period), then optimization is performed with a fine (user-defined) step size near the optimum. The temporal calibration class is now split into a few smaller classes to make it more readable and to facilitate the application for registering any metric (not just video-tracker but also tracker-tracker temporal calibration).

#### 2011-10-29, 21:15:45 - Andras Lasso
Everything seems OK.

You get link errors because you try to use the internal functions of the vtkMicronTrackerfiles package. In vtkMicronTracker.cxx/h you should only use the public interface defined in MicronTrackerInterface.h. If you want to access internals of the MicronTracker driver then you can do it within the vtkMicronTrackerfiles package (but probably it won't be necessary).

Do you have any suggestions

#### 2011-10-31, 16:10:33 - Andras Lasso
The public interface of MicronTracker should give you access to configure and accwss all the markers. But if yoi find that you need to expose more functionality on the public interface then feel free to modify it.

This is the function that causes the error. this->MT->mtFindUnidentifiedMarkers

#### 2011-11-01, 17:20:20 - Csaba Pinter
Yes it is.
If you don't know how to use visual studio for debugging, you can call me on skype and share your screen or let me log in remotely using LogMeIn or something.
Anyway, we already see what's causing the error. Unfortunately since I don't have this file, I can't see what goes wrong at line 603. My guess is the overindexing a vector, possibly using std::vector::end which gives the iterator to the one after the last one instead of the last one.

#### 2011-11-01, 17:21:57 - Csaba Pinter
Also I'd like to ask you to compress the images you want to upload to Assembla (you can use jpeg, png or gif for example). Thank you!

Hussam,
1. Please don't attach 5MB screenshots! (use jpg, png, or gif instead of uncompressed bmp).
2. Use a vtkDataCollectorTrackingTest test application for debugging the tracker, not a complex application like fCal


#### 2011-11-01, 19:56:52 - hussam.ashab
Csaba,

1- For sure I will ask for your help (Thank you).

2- It is my mistake I did not make the problem clear (I will avoid it in future)

   a- the program used to break at vtkAccurateTimer::Delay {when  I strat fcal --> connect, while the marker is shown}, I though there was something I added to the config file that caused it to break, 
       since it was not an error in vtkmicrontracker. (This error is now at this->MT->mtFindUnidentifiedMarkers). I will try to debug it. If I could not know the reason, I will ask for you help (if you do not mind).
       (I made somechanges today morning which reduced the number of errors I used to get)

   b- When I used to debug the code I was getting soruce file does not exist (Microntrakerinterface , even though it was there. This problem was solved when I rebuilt PLUS).

   c- I may need to change some functions in vtkMicrontracker, Can I do that.

#### 2011-11-01, 19:57:09 - hussam.ashab
Andras,

1- I deleted the files, I will avoid that in future.

2- I will use that test. Thank you.

#### 2011-11-01, 20:09:14 - Andras Lasso
2a -> Hussam, don't use fcal for the debugging/testing/tuning of such a low-level feature. If anything breaks at the vrey low level then a complex application may show various kinds of errors that is very difficult to analyze. Just use the  vtkDataCollectorTrackingTest test application for debugging the tracker. Update your view before doing so, as Tomi added some more detailed logging into that test to help you with the debugging.

#### 2011-11-01, 22:45:36 - hussam.ashab
ok, I will do that. 

Thanks

#### 2011-11-02, 19:41:08 - hussam.ashab
Hi,

1- I was able to connect to MicronTracker throught fCal using a config file.

2- I created Tools folder in Plus_App/fCal and created  ToolNames.txt  in that folder. This txt file contains the names of markers I will use.

3- I put the markers file in  Plus_App/fCal  because fCal looks for markers in that folder (May be I have to change that)

4- I looked at other tracking codes 'vtkBrachyTracker.cxx' and 'vtkAscension3DGTracker.cxx' they use port number for stylus, probe and reference, But MicronTracker does have portnumbers for stylus,probe and reference markers. Any suggestions ? (I talked to Andras about this today and he said this will be changed to PortName)

5- I tried to see what will happen and gave probe, reference and stylus port numbers 0,1,2. When I run fcal->Stylus Calibration. Any of the three markers I have is detected and it's measurements are used.? Any suggestion (Am I doing something wrong).

NOTES: Please I have these two problems, do you have any suggestions: 

A- In the InternalUpdate function I added Sleep() function, May be I have to change it. But if I do not use that function, there will be errors in grabbing frame. (This function is called by thread very quickly and may be micronTracker cannot grab frames at that frame rate)

B- Whenever there is an error in grabbing a frame and the program gets to 'LOG_ERROR('Error in grabbing a frame! %s \
' << this->MT->mtGetErrorString());' it gives access violation error. I think because mtGetErrorString() does not have any data 'I mean string'. Line 285 vtkMicrontracker.cxx

Next time please include the ticket number in your commit comment, then we can see all the related commits in the ticket history. Example: re #348: Added ReadConfiguration and …

2,3 - Don't create new config files. If you need to store any additional configuration information then just add it to the xml config file. Could you attach your txt files here so that we can see what information you need to store in them?

4 - contact Tamas Heffter about this, you can send him an email or a private message through assembla (he doesn't monitor this issue, so he won't chime in unless you ask him)

5 - you have to identify the marker based on the PortName and set the transform in the corresponding tool using ToolTimeStampedUpdate(i, ...)

A - Remove the Sleep function! If the update rate is too high then just  lower the value of the Frequency attribute of the Tracker element in the config file (<Tracker ... Frequency='20' ...>)

B - The problem was that you called InternalStopTracking first, which deleted the MT object, then you called a member of the MT object. Also, there was an unnecessary %s in the string (it's required only for printf, but not when constructing strings using streams). I've committed the fix (see revision 1099).

The code is quite messy, I clean it up and add support for PortName in about an hour and check in.

#### 2011-11-02, 22:08:12 - hussam.ashab
Regarding my part, This is what I told you today. I am still not sure how some functions work and I have to organize it. But since you wanted to take a look at it. I committed the code. I am sorry for that part.

#### 2011-11-02, 23:37:49 - hussam.ashab
These are the only parts I added to the code

{
  ReadToolsFile();
  RefreshMarkerTemplates();  //
  Probe();          // setup and attach to cameras. IsTracking will be set to 1.
  Connect();


  return PLUS_SUCCESS;
}

PlusStatus vtkMicronTracker::Connect()
{ 

  // Enable tools
  for ( int tool = 0; tool < this->GetNumberOfTools(); tool ++ )
  {
      this->GetTool( tool )->EnabledOn();

  }
  
  return PLUS_SUCCESS;


}

#### 2011-11-02, 23:39:15 - hussam.ashab
and the following functions are defined before:

ReadToolsFile();
RefreshMarkerTemplates(); 
Probe(); 
Connect();

So only I put them in readConfiguration (these were there only for testing)

Hussam, it's good that you committed the code. I know that the existing MicronTracker interface code was quite ugly (as we didn't use the MicronTracker, we didn't clean-up the code).

#### 2011-11-03, 15:11:24 - hussam.ashab
Thank you andras. I appreciate your help

#### 2011-11-03, 20:29:41 - hussam.ashab
Hi,

I am getting this errors:

1- less than two vectors are detected it is at vtkmicronTracker (198).

2- stylus tool not found (Here I debug it and found that stylus tool does not get enables).

I found that you removed these function:

1- ReadToolsFile() {So using the Config file we can get the same info we used to get before}

Notes: 

1- this->MT->mtSetupCameras() is used twice once in Conncet and once in probe.


#### 2011-11-03, 20:31:52 - hussam.ashab
Only can I know why you deleted 'ReadToolsFile' So I can continue debugging the code.

#### 2011-11-03, 20:53:07 - Andras Lasso
I've removed ReadToolsFile because all the configuration information shall be stored in the config XML file. The tools file contained only the tool names. This information is now stored in the config file as PortName (see https://www.assembla.com/code/plus/subversion/nodes/trunk/PlusLib/data/ConfigFiles/PlusConfiguration_SonixTouch_MicronTracker_L14_fCal.xml?rev=1105).

Probe: As the name of the method suggests, this method is only for checking if the hardware is available. Usually we don't call this method. It may be useful when you want to do hardware auto-detection in your application. So, it's normal that we connect (set up cameras, etc.) and disconnect in the probe method.



#### 2011-11-04, 00:54:46 - hussam.ashab
Hi,

I think this part gives error (Internalupdate)

  // Collecting new samples if creating a new template by the user
  int collectNewSamplesResult=this->MT->mtCollectNewSamples(this->IsAdditionalFacetAdding);
  if ( collectNewSamplesResult == -1)
  {

    return PLUS_FAIL;
  }
  else if (collectNewSamplesResult == 1)
  {
    LOG_ERROR('More than two vectors are detected.');
    return PLUS_FAIL;
  }
  else if (collectNewSamplesResult == 99)
  {
    LOG_ERROR('No known facet detected.');
    return PLUS_FAIL;
  }

  this->NewSampleFramesCollected++;
  LOG_TRACE('Samples collected so far: ' << this->NewSampleFramesCollected);

I will rewrite it

#### 2011-11-04, 01:53:24 - Andras Lasso
Yes, of course. Feel free to rewrite it. I tried to keep the same sequence of method calls for getting the transforms but I couldn't test it without the hardware, so I wouldn't be surprised if there were errors in that part.

#### 2011-11-04, 16:12:16 - hussam.ashab
const char* portName = config->GetAttribute('PortName'); 'vtkTracker ln 511'

returns 0 always, it cannot read PortName in Configuration File ?

#### 2011-11-04, 16:39:45 - Andras Lasso
Are you sure you set the PortName in the config file?
see the sample config file https://www.assembla.com/code/plus/subversion/nodes/trunk/PlusLib/data/ConfigFiles/PlusConfiguration_SonixTouch_MicronTracker_L14_fCal.xml?rev=1105

The PortName variable is set in vtkTracker::ReadConfiguration(vtkXMLDataElement* config) - you can check with a debugger if the value is properly set there.


#### 2011-11-04, 17:21:43 - hussam.ashab
yes, I am sure I set the PortName correctly.

This part of code is in vtkTracker::ReadConfiguration ln 510

        const char* portName = config->GetAttribute('PortName'); 
        if ( portName != NULL )    // HERE it does not get to the if statement, because portName is NULL
        {
          this->GetTool(portNumber)->SetPortName(portName); 
        }

        this->GetTool(portNumber)->ReadConfiguration(toolDataElement); 
      }

Do you have any suggestions ?

(In r:1123) re #348: Fixed PortName parameter reading

#### 2011-11-04, 17:33:12 - hussam.ashab
Ok, I want to summerize what I did (may be I am doing something wrong)

1- when the program get to vtktracker, it 'if (portNumber < this->GetNumberOfTools() )' this->GetNumberOfTools() =0 so it does not enter to the if statement 'it is at ln 506'

2- I looked at vtkAscension3DGTracker code and found they set 'this->SetNumberOfTools(12); at ln 60' so I did the same for vtkMicronTracker and set it to 3 'this->SetNumberOfTools(3); ' but after that I was getting the previous problem which is  'const char* portName = config->GetAttribute('PortName'); '  returns NULL for portName.

Am I missing anything ?

#### 2011-11-04, 17:41:08 - hussam.ashab
I think it is working now, I have to test it, I made some changes to vtkMicronTracker 'to make it work' I will commit the code. if you do not mind.

Thank you for your help

When I go to phantom registeration. There is a problem in the registeration. if the phantom is moved, the registeration falls. may be it is because the 'stylusTipToReferenceMatrix' does not get data from phantom marker 'patientMarker'.

Have you attached the reference marker to the phantom box?

#### 2011-11-04, 23:12:12 - hussam.ashab
Yes, I attached the patientMarker to the phantom. If you want I can send you a video or I can preform the calibration online using skype. to see if I am doing anything wrong

#### 2011-11-04, 23:25:02 - Andras Lasso
Are you sure that all the tools are tracked properly? fCal shouldn't be used for debugging. If you find any problem then use lower-level test applications, such as vtkDataCollectorTrackingTest. You can use the same config file (--input-config-file-name) as for fCal and get the transform for the selected tool (--input-tool-name).

#### 2011-11-04, 23:29:05 - hussam.ashab
ok, I will use that function. I was getting the data from markers. I will test it again and let you know

Seq_Frame0000_Status = TR_OUT_OF_VIEW 

I will debug it and see why it gives status is out of view.
But using fcal it can detect the markers ?! 

#### 2011-11-05, 14:20:16 - Andras Lasso
Have you actually modified the code to set these string values? You should just specify the using command-line parameters (see sample command lines on the dashboard, e.g., http://crunch.cs.queensu.ca/CDash/testDetails.php?test=31059&build=3595)

Both fCal and DataCollectorTest1 use the same vtkDataCollector class to connect to devices and get tracking and imaging information. If DataCollectorTest1 doesn't work perfectly then it means that there is no chance that fCal will work.

#### 2011-11-07, 16:03:29 - hussam.ashab
Yes,

I modified the folloinwg parts:

std::string inputConfigFileName('C:/devel/PlusExperimental bin/PlusLib/data/ConfigFiles/PlusConfiguration_SonixTouch_MicronTracker_L14_fCal1_HUSSAM.xml');
std::string inputToolName('Stylus');
double inputAcqTimeLength(60);
std::string outputTrackerBufferSequenceFileName('TrackerBufferMetafile');
std::string outputFolder('./');

and it gave me the results shown above.

I do not think it can identify the markers, I will look why ?!

Looks good.

#### 2011-11-07, 17:26:16 - hussam.ashab
Thank you Andras fro your time. Since this part is working. how to solve the following problem, which I posted before:

'When I go to phantom registeration. There is a problem in the registeration. if the phantom is moved, the registeration falls. may be it is because the 'stylusTipToReferenceMatrix' does not get data from phantom marker 'patientMarker'. I am trying to find out the problem. Please let me know if you have any suggestions '

 Since debuging fCal is not appropriate. what you suggest.




#### 2011-11-07, 17:30:08 - Andras Lasso
Complete the registration in fCal without moving the phantom. Then enable tool visualization and verify if all the tracked items move on the screen as they move in reality.

#### 2011-11-07, 18:16:31 - hussam.ashab
I register the phantom and when the registration is done. if I move the phantom the stylus cannot follow the phantom. to make it clear. If I change the location of phantom i cannot anymore touch the markers on the phantom and see it on fCal.

#### 2011-11-07, 18:40:44 - Andras Lasso
Maybe your config file doesn't define the reference correctly. Is your config file under source control? If not, then please upload.

I would suggest to verify that each tracked tools moves on the screen the same way as they move in reality. You can try to use fCal for this as I described (complete the Freehand Calibration step and enable the 'Show devices' checkbox to show a 3D view of all the tracked tools, see the attached screenshot for an example). Alternatively, you can visualize the tools in 3D Slicer: just send the live transforms to 3DSlicer using OpenIGTLink using the vtkDataCollectorTest1 application (Tamas demonstrated this at UBC), or if you don't want to work with live data then just record the data with vtkDataCollectorTest1 into a metafile and send the transforms from the metafile to 3D Slicer using the ReplayRecordedDataTest.


#### 2011-11-07, 22:12:54 - hussam.ashab
Hi,

Please can you take a look at my config file (I uploaded it). Also ReplayRecordedDataTest needs a videobuffermeta.mha file. which DataCollectorTest1 does not generate.

regards


#### 2011-11-07, 22:43:59 - Andras Lasso
The config file looks OK. Which one do you use: PlusConfiguration_SonixTouch_MicronTracker_3.2_L14_fCal1.xml or PlusConfiguration_SonixTouch_MicronTracker_L14_fCal.xml? Please remove the one that you don't use.

Sorry, I was wrong, the ReplayRecordedDataTest does not broadcast OpenIGTLink messages. You can use the vtkDataCollectorTest1 to replay recorded sequences (using <Tracker Type='SavedDataset' ... ).


#### 2011-11-09, 18:38:13 - hussam.ashab
I am using PlusConfiguration_SonixTouch_MicronTracker_3.2_L14_fCal1.xml. The problem is vtkDataCollectorTest1 needs that inputVideoBufferMetafile which I do not get using vtkDataCollectorTrackingTest ?

Also I did stylus calibration -> phantom calibration while it is fixed in its place->freehand calibration. when i start freehnad calibration it cannot detect lines. I think fCal does not recognize probemarker and patientmarker ? since you told me not to debug fCal. Is there any suggestions?

#### 2011-11-09, 19:24:22 - Andras Lasso
First you have to make absolutely sure that all the transforms you get from all the tracker tools are correct. You cannot easily do that in fCal, that's why you should either use vtkDataCollectorTrackingTest&Slicer or create a small test application that you (and others in the future) could use for troubleshooting.

For vtkDataCollectorTrackingTest: You you can just use saved data and any mha file as video source. I would suggest to use live tracking data to verify that all the coordinate axes directions, rotation directions etc. in Slicer match the physical reality. You should be able to use any 3D Slicer version (or the version that we showed you at UBC: https://www.assembla.com/spaces/plus/wiki/Slicer_and_Plus_tutorial_August_2011_Vancouver).


#### 2011-11-09, 21:39:35 - hussam.ashab
Thank you for your help. I think my problem is not I am getting wrong transforms. The problem is when I go to phantom registeration fCal does not include the pose measurments of the phantom marker. So if I calibrate the phantom at a fixed position then move the phantom it does not show any relative movement. To make it clear there is no input from phantom marker, so the registeration is depending only on the info from the stylus marker only. 

Please can we talk for 5 min on skype. to make it clear and know exactly what to do?

Hi,

I was able to get the transformation Matrixs and do phantom registeration. when I do free hand calibration and the progress bar reachs 100%, fCal crashes . Do you have any idea ? I uploaded a screen print above.

The error doesn't seem to be related to the MicronTracker, so I've entered a new ticket for that: #380.

Until Csaba fixes the crash you can try these workarounds:
* Copy the missing STL files from the PlusLib\\data\\CADModels... directories => Try again
* Update Plus to the latest revision (PlusBuild and build PlusBuild.sln) => Try again
* Build an installation package (PlusApp-bin\\CreatePackage.bat), install the package => Try with the installed Plus version

Hi Hussam, have you seen the code review comments that I've sumitted (see https://www.assembla.com/code/plus/subversion/changesets/1176)? When do you plan to fix those? We plan to create a new Plus release by the end of the month. For this the MicronTracker code has to be cleaned up and documented till the end of this week. Let me know if you need help with that.

Overall it's a nice progress that you could make the MicronTracker work in Plus.
Thanks!
Andras

Hi,

Sorry for the late response. I did not forgot  to do that. But Can I have some time? because I am working on a project that I have to delivere at the begining of Dec and it depends on MirconTracker which I could make it work before one week.

also I have this problem with PLUS

Error  1  error PRJ0019: A tool returned an error code from 'Performing configure step for 'PlusLib''  PlusLib

Please let me know if you can give me some time.

Are you using fCal when you get this error?
If you are, then your device set config file is the problem. Please see any fCal-related device set configuration files in the repository (PlusLib/data/ConfigFiles) for the changes you have to apply to your configuration file.

Please attach a log file,the used device set configuration file and a short description whenever you submit a problem.

#### 2011-11-29, 01:20:29 - hussam.ashab
Ok I changed the config file. I can connect to US machine, do stylus calibration. But then when I go to phantom registeration It does not load the the modle. 

I saved the stylus calibration in the previous step and try to load it when I am at the phantom registeration part. but fCal crashes.

I will attach the output file and a screen print.

You don't have to save and load the results if you want to do the whole workflow, but just switch to the next tab.
Saving makes sense if you want to save a partial result on purpose.

Can I please ask you to wait for us to finish our current milestone? We are really in the middle of a major re-factoring of the tracker tools and transforms, and it is absolutely no wonder that some of these stuff don't work. I tested the normal workflow, but these minor and rarely used features like import results were left out. Of course when we finish our current work, everything is supposed to work.

We plan to finish our rework this week. Then we test it, fix it and release it as 1.4.0. It should be working from then on, and we are more than welcome to recieve these bug reports.

#### 2011-11-29, 15:59:36 - Andras Lasso
Hossam, if you need to present MicronTracker support till Dec 5. you have the following options:
1. If you could do everything that you wanted with a previous Plus version then you can checkout that older version and do everything with that.
2. You ask Purang for an extension (presentation one week later), so that you can show a fully operational and tested software
3. You just create a presentation (you can create the screenshots etc. with Ascension and an older Plus version) and tell the audience that MicronTracker support is almost done, just need to be adapted to the new tracker tool design.
4. There is a slight chance that your specific problems can be all fixed before Sunday. But I cannot guarantee that. You have to discuss that with Tomi and Csaba. It's a bit risky.

I see in the log “…TEMPORARY ISSUE: …”, which suggests that you just have to wait for the redesign to be completed (which should happen by tomorrow).

#### 2011-12-02, 22:09:06 - Csaba Pinter
That's right. You have to wait until we finish our rework, as I previously mentioned. Sorry again for the inconvenience.

Today we agreed that we will create branches for the stable versions so that external developers like you don't experience these issues.

#### 2011-12-02, 23:42:46 - Siavash Khallaghi
Having external branches for stable releases is a very good idea. I really support it.

Guys, 
I've been working on #377: Relative transform computation should be implemented in the tracking base classes
I've found the following code snippet in MicronTracker implementation: 


~~~~

if(strcmp(identifiedTemplateName,'patientMarker')==0)
    {
      GetReferenceTransformMatrix(identifedMarkerIndex, mTrackerToReference);
      mTrackerToReference->Invert();
      this->ToolTimeStampedUpdate( tool->GetToolName(), mTrackerToReference, TOOL_OK, this->LastFrameNumber, unfilteredTimestamp);
    }
    else
    {
      GetTransformMatrix(identifedMarkerIndex, mToolToTracker);
      vtkMatrix4x4::Multiply4x4( mTrackerToReference, mToolToTracker , mToolToReference );
      this->ToolTimeStampedUpdate( tool->GetToolName(), mToolToReference, TOOL_OK, this->LastFrameNumber, unfilteredTimestamp);
    }


~~~~


Could you please tell me some details about it? Is the patientMarker tool your reference tool, and you get all the other transforms relative to that coordinate system? With the new implementation of the tools, we're expecting all tool transforms relative to the tracker coordinate frame and the vtkTransformRepository will compute the tool to reference transformation if desired. Can I change the implementation? 

 

#### 2011-12-03, 20:16:52 - hussam.ashab
Hi,

I will remove the harcoded part 'patientMarker'. This marker is attached to the phantom and it is the reference. To make it clear the marker on the phantom is the reference tool. As I read throw plus and other sensor implementation I found they do that. So i followed what was done.

I do not know about changing the implementation because I can decide that.

regards
Hussam

#### 2011-12-03, 20:39:34 - Tamas Heffter
Thank you Hussam, that would help a lot. You're right, that's a new implementation, previously we implemented the same way, we just changed it this week. 
Let me know if you need help.

Hi,

I calibrated the probe and Was able to display all of tools. but I noticed that the probe when displayed it is shifted in the z direction. Do you have any suggestion what I have to do to solve it. stylus and phantom are working fine.

I attached image and output file

regards
Hussam

If everything is well visible on one frame of the video then don't upload a video. Use another video player (such as VLC) and turn off hardware acceleration or save a snapshot of a single frame.

#### 2011-12-06, 00:16:23 - Csaba Pinter
The displacement of the probe is almost surely due to a wrong ModelToTool transform in the configuration file.

You can register it together using Slicer for instance, recording landmarks on the probe, and registering them to the same points you measure on the STL file of the probe.

If you use a different type of probe, I would be happy if you uploaded its model to our repository.

One more thing: we re-designed this very part in the configuration file structure, so in the future, instead of the PlusConfiguration/DataCollection/Tracker/Tool/Model section you can find it in the PlusConfiguration/Rendering/DisplayableTool section (it may also change)

#### 2011-12-06, 18:27:46 - Andras Lasso
Hossam, as Csaba wrote the misalignment of the displayed probe model may be normal (it just means that the model to marker transform is not determined for your setup). We entered a new ticket (#404) to automatically display the model in the correct position. When it's ready then the model will always appear at the correct position (aligned to the image).

#### 2011-12-13, 18:22:41 - hussam.ashab
Hi,

I hard coded this part 'if(strcmp(identifiedTemplateName,'patientMarker')==0)' do you have any suggestion to do it in different way.

regards

#### 2011-12-13, 18:38:53 - Andras Lasso
In the tracker implementation you can remove all code related to computing transformations relative to a reference frame. In the latest trunk version the tracker always reports transforms relative to the tracker coordinate frame (StylusToTracker, ProbeToTracker, ...).
Computation of relative transforms (StylusToReference, ProbeToReference, ...) are computed at a higher level, using the TransformRepository.

If you want to run fCal for example, then just modify the config file like this:
<fCal
 ...
    ReferenceCoordinateFrame='PatientMarker'
  />

Note the capital 'P' for PatientMarker. Coordinate frame names shall start with a capital letter (it's because transform names are saved as Frame1ToFrame2 and the transform name is parsed to get the two frame names from that; but if you have a frame name starting with a lowercase letter then you may get a transform name like frame1Toframe2, from that the coordinate frames cannot be extracted reliably)

#### 2012-05-18, 13:37:37 - Andras Lasso
Need to do some more cleanup in the interface classes:
* VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAMMING NOTE in MicronTrackerInterface.cpp
* check ownedByMe handling (probably it should be set to false if the handle is not created by new)
* consistent return values (sometimes int, sometimes bool; sometimes non-zero means error, sometimes 0, false)
* check timestamp computation
* etc.

## #355 fCal is temporarily unresponsive after tools are out of view

## #358 Memory leaks related to vtkXMLDataElement handling
References to vtkXMLDataElement are managed incorrectly at many places throughout the code (the ownership of vtkXMLDataElements are not transferred correctly to the caller methods).


*ReadElementFromFile* - Use the *Take* method of the smart pointer, as reading creates a new vtkXMLDataElement object and the caller method need to take ownership of that (delete it when not used anymore):
CORRECT: vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLDataElement> configRootElement = vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLDataElement>::Take( vtkXMLUtilities::ReadElementFromFile(inputConfigFileName.c_str()) );
WRONG (leaks memory): vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLDataElement> configRootElement = vtkXMLUtilities::ReadElementFromFile(inputConfigFileName.c_str());

*FindNestedElementWithName, LookupElementWithNameContainingChildWithNameAndAttribute, etc.* - They just return a pointer to an existing child element of an XML tree, therefore there is no ownership transfer (no need to delete the retrieved child element, it will be deleted when the root element is deleted):
CORRECT: vtkXMLDataElement* dataCollectionConfig = aConfigurationData->FindNestedElementWithName('USDataCollection');
WRONG (confusing, unnecessary complex usage): vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLDataElement> dataCollectionConfig = aConfigurationData->FindNestedElementWithName('USDataCollection');

(In r:1088) Test #359: Logging of number of segmented images in a recording round changed to debug level and improved

#### 2011-11-02, 16:18:09 - Csaba Pinter
The new implementation works in Release mode with default settings well, but in Debug mode or with higher image acquisition frame rate or on a slower machine it causes problems.
If the segmentation of the newly arrived images takes more time than what the function has (which is defined by the recording frame rate in the application), then in the next recording cycle it has to segment even more images (as there was more time for acquisition), which takes even more time. So the time needed for recording increases drastically and the application looks like hanged after a while.
Although this phenomenon does not occur in the normal circumstances (release mode, decent computer, reasonable acquisition frame rate), we should find out something against this issue.

(In r:1096) Re #359: When shooting the timer for next recording cycle, the time needed for segmenting the acquired images are taken into account (the time spent in the function before is subtracted from the interval computed from the recording frame rate) - Note: the problem defined in the ticket is not solved, but it is slightly better (and the frame rate is actually frame rate now)

#### 2011-11-02, 19:53:53 - Csaba Pinter
We agreed in adding a parameter to the GetTrackedFrameList function in vtkDataCollector that maximizes the number of tracked frames got from it. In case of -1 all the frames are appended, but in case of values greater or equals 0, that many last tracked frames are appended only.

In the applications where timers are used for recording (iCal, fCal), this function is called with a carefully computed parameter. The applications read two parameters from the device set configuration file (their sections). In fCal I defined them as RecordingIntervalMs and MaxTimeSpentWithProcessingMs. The first one is the interval between the calls of the recording functions, the second is the maximum time that one recording function call should spend processing. The application computes and stores the average processing time of a frame and (in the next round) uses that value to determine how many tracked frames it requests from the data collector.

If the processing cannot keep up with the acquisition a warning message should be logged.

## #365 Incorrect include directory for ulterius_def.h in vtkImageAcquisition
Hi Guys,

Saman and I are having trouble performing a clean build for Plus. The vtkImageAcquisition and other Ulterius-dependent projects in Plus-Lib fail. Basically, the compiler complains that it cannot find ulterius_def.h. The build log and CMake-Cache are attached. Here is what we have done:

1. Checked out PLTools from: https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/pltools/. The check out location on my PC is C:\\devel\\PLTools.
2. Updated Plus-build.
3. Deleted everything in Plus-bin.
4. Started the CMake-Gui and set the source directory to Plus-build and the binary directory to Plus-bin (which is empty).
5. Checked the box for PLUS_USE_ULTRASONIX_VIDEO. The Ulteris SDK version was untouched (default value of 5.6.4).
6. Set the path for Ultrasonix in CMake to C:\\devel\\PLTools\  runk\\Ultrasonix.
7. Build the super-build.

When the super-build generated the PlusLib, I checked the additional include directories in project properties for vtkImageAcquisition. It turns out that it points to C:\\devel\\PLTools\  runk\\Ultrasonix\\ulterius\\inc, which does not exist.

So either we (Saman and I) have set the ULTRASONIX_SDK_DIR in the CMake incorrectly (which is highly unlikely), or there is something wrong with the CMakeLists.txt file.

I would appreciate it if you guys could have a look at it.

Thank you,

Siavash

#### 2011-11-02, 10:21:25 - Siavash Khallaghi
A work around for this is to use C:\\devel\\PLTools\  runk\\Ultrasonix\\sdk-5.6.4 as the Ultrasonix-path in the CMake-GUI. Is this the way that it is intended to include Ultrasonix? If this is the case, please close the ticket and add a comment on the Wiki.

Thank you

Siavash

#### 2011-11-02, 12:47:17 - Tamas Ungi
I use Windows 7, but I think it should be the same.
When I configured PlusBuild with CMake (yesterday), it found Ultrasonix automatically in
C:/Users/ungi/PLTools/Ultrasonix/sdk-5.6.4
My PlusBuild bin is in
C:/Users/ungi/PlusBuild

If PLTools is next to your PlusBuild bin dir, it should find it. But what you did, specifying the Ultrasonix dir manually is also a good way.

#### 2011-11-02, 13:31:02 - Tamas Heffter
Siavash, 

We've recently removed PLTools from the PlusBuild, because the Ultrasonix and NDI specific libraries were not freely available from the internet. So, as Tamas suggested, you check out the PLTools directory to the same level as PlusBuild directory, and it will find the selected version automatically, or you can set the folder manually as you did. 

If you have any question, feel free to ask it, otherwise let me know if we can close the ticket.

## #366 Fiducial segmentation code clean-up
The fiducial segmentation code needs clean-up:
* Item, Pos, and Position all store just a 2d position => keep only one
* dot stores both r, c and x, y coordinates => need to clean up
* KPhantomSeg class is defined in both UltraSoundFiducialSegmentation and kphantseg.h => remove the files that are not used anymore
* Fix method names capitalization: this_is_wrong => ThisIsCorrect
* Fix member variable names: prepend m_ to all attribute names, don't use such short member variable names like: b, p, t, l1, l2 (e.g., in FidPatternRecognitionCommon), but at least a complete word
* Add comments for each class, method, and member variable

-For 'Pos' I assume you meant 'Dot'.
-Item and Position have been deleted, only Dot remains. However this is terrible for the meaning of the algorithm, Item was a poorly chosen name but stored 'Items' that are completely different from 'dots': shapes used by the morphological operations. I don't think it made the future debugging easier.
-I dont get the 'dot stores both r, c and x, y coordinates => need to clean up', Dot only contains x and y while Item contains r and c. Anyway it's cleaned up and only the x and y remain.

#### 2011-11-02, 16:34:48 - Andras Lasso
-For 'Pos' I meant 'Pos', see segimpl.h
-Feel free to rename Dot whatever name that represents its role. You can replace Item with int[2], there is no need to create a class with get/set functions for storing a 2d vector.
-Dot: There is a class Dot in FidPatternRecognitionCommon.h with m_X, m_Y, m_DotIntensity attributes, and there is also a struct Dot in segimpl.h with r, c, intensity attributes.

#### 2011-11-02, 16:43:45 - Alexis Boucharin
All the previous files that you are talking about (segimpl.h, kphantseg.h, etc.) have not been used for months and were only kept 'just in case' on demand. I don't think they are even included anywhere. I'll check and will remove them accordingly.

## #367 Move tracker speed and position validation parameters setting to application level
Now the maximum allowed speed and minimum required position difference parameters are defined at the tracker level in the config files:
<Tracker ...
        MaxAllowedTranslationSpeedMmPerSec='10.0'
        MaxAllowedRotationSpeedDegPerSec='15.0'
        MinRequiredTranslationDifferenceMm='0.5'
        MinRequiredAngleDifferenceDeg='5.0' >

These parameters are not necessarily constant throughout the execution of the application, so it should be the application's responsibility to read these values from the config file and set it in the trackers

<iCal version='1.0' NumberOfImagesForValidation='50'    >
  <CalibrationData Type='CALIB_TEMPLATE_TRANSLATION' NumberOfImagesToAcquire='50' FrameTransformNameForValidation='' MaxAllowedTranslationSpeedMmPerSec='10.0'
        MaxAllowedRotationSpeedDegPerSec='15.0' MinRequiredTranslationDifferenceMm='0.5' MinRequiredAngleDifferenceDeg='5.0' />
  ...
</iCal>

Move frame validation into vtkTrackedFrameList::AddTrackedFrame() (and make frame ValidateData() protected).

## #370 Add scripts dir to PlusConfig

#### 2011-11-05, 16:24:25 - Tamas Heffter
status: changed from "New" to "Fixed"


## #371 Gnuplot cannot be found by automatic nightly tests
4 nightly tests fail on all configurations (see http://crunch.cs.queensu.ca/CDash/viewTest.php?onlyfailed&buildid=3632) because gnuplot directory is not set correctly.

The problem is that:
* PlusLib uses PlusConfig.xml to get some information that is required for testing (such as the gnuplot directory) but it's only set in PlusApp. I think PlusConfig.xml should be generated in PlusLib as the vtkPlusConfig class is implemented in PlusLib and some tests in PlusLib rely on the PlusConfig.xml file.
* Somehow we need to enforce that the PlusConfig.xml file contents either at configuration, build, or test execution time. Currently the tests update the PlusConfig.xml, so it has a more recent date than the input files, therefore it never gets updated.


#### 2011-11-07, 14:46:42 - Andras Lasso
Maybe this would be a working solution for the PlusConfig.xml update:
* Generate a PlusConfigDefault.xml file (or something similar name) in the configuration step
* Create a custom build step to copy PlusConfigDefault.xml to PlusConfig.xml during build

Then a make clean would delete PlusConfig.xml, but the custom build step could recreate the PlusConfig.xml (by copying it from the PlusConfigDefault.xml).

#### 2011-11-07, 16:24:59 - Tamas Heffter
Or, can't we just 'force' the configure step to override the plusconfig for the next (actually the next 2 days)? These values are constants, so with the new build it will work flawlessly, however not a nice solution?!! Now, we're checking if the PlusConfig.xml is there, if so we don't modify it. If we just comment out the file exist check, it would set the correct paths. The only problem is that the PlusApp config will generate the file, and usually the PlusLib tests are the first. So the PlusLib test will fail on the first day, than it will overwrite it. Actually, we could also move the config generation to PlusLib (the one that copies the files to the PLUS_EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH), and leave the configuration file generation for the install in PlusApp. Than, it would solve the two days issue. 

IF ( NOT EXISTS '${PLUS_EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH}/Release/PlusConfig.xml' )
        configure_file(
            ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/PlusConfig.xml.in
            ${PLUS_EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH}/Release/PlusConfig.xml
            )  
ENDIF()



#### 2011-11-07, 16:26:54 - Andras Lasso
OK, then just remove the NOT EXISTS checking and move the file generation to PlusLib.

## #377 Relative transform computation should be implemented in the tracking base classes
Currently  if a reference tool is appointed then it's the responsibility of each tracker class (vtkAscension3DGTracker, vtkNDICertusTracker, vtkMicronTracker, ...) to make all the transforms relative to this transform. 

Remove reference transform dependency from all classes and use vtkTransformRepository in the application layer. 
An example can be found in TrusCalibration\  esting\\vtkPhantomRegistrationTest.cxx

Strange, it worked for me when I closed it...

We're actually in the middle of rethinking the tracker tools, and that specific row where your crash occured changed, so I can't fix it right now, we have to finish our rework first.

What is very interesting in your log is the path where it tries to find the stl files (.../Alexis/...). Deleting your PlusConfig.xml in the binary directories may fix your problem at once.
If not, a solution for you could be to copy the stl files in the configuration folder somewhere (doesn't matter where, the search is recursive).

## #381 Ulterius SDK version change should automatically update the SDK directory location
Several times developers had problems with Plus compilation because they changed the SDK version, but didn't change the SDK directory location.

It's particularly confusing when at first the directory location found automatically (in PLTools), but then after changing the SDK version and reconfiguring the directory location is not updated to reflect the new SDK version.

If the directory was manually set then probably we don't have to automatically update the directory on SDK version is change.

## #387 Revise tracked frame status field
Currently we set the tracked frame status to the 'Probe' tool status is we have it, otherwise to the first active tool status. The tracked frame can be valid even if we don't have 'Probe' tool or the first active tool is missing (like stylus is out of view, but we need to track the needle to reference without the probe). This collective tracked frame status doesn't make any sense since we don't have default tool name. Need to change vtkDataCollector::GetTrackedFrameByTime according to this modification.

#### 2011-11-23, 02:58:46 - Siavash Khallaghi
Thank you Andras. I can verify that changing the sector size through the Set macro changes the sector size on the exam software.

However when we call the FrameRate it returns -1. Is this how it supposed to work?

#### 2011-11-23, 03:08:41 - Andras Lasso
I don't think you can *set* a frame rate using Ulterius. Frame rate is determined by a number of factors, including depth, sector size, transmitter frequency, processing parameters, ...
If you call the vtkSonixVideoSource::PrintListOfImagingParameters() method then you get a list of parameters that you can change using Ulterius. You can experiment with setting those to achieve a desired frame rate.


#### 2011-11-23, 03:13:09 - Siavash Khallaghi
I am not trying to set the frame rate. I am trying to get the actual frame rate. To me, it seems that GetFrameRate() should return the framerate that is displayed on the machine. Am I wrong?

GetFrameRate() returns the requested frame rate. If you call the vtkSonixVideoSource::PrintListOfImagingParameters() method then you get a list of parameters that you can get using Ulterius. If you find anything like 'displayed frame rate' or similar then you can simply add a GetDisplayedFrameRate() function to vtkSonixVideoSource.

#### 2011-12-02, 02:33:59 - Siavash Khallaghi
Hi Andras,

I tried vtkSonixVideoSource::PrintListOfImagingParameters(), but it prints every imaging parameter. This is not what I need.

I need to print and pass the frameRate to an elastography block. I cannot change the input for this block since the developer does not share source code.

I looked into the vtkSonixVideoSource::GetParamValue and I see that it is protected. Is there anyway to access the frameRate from outside vtkSonixVideoSource?

Siavash

#### 2011-12-02, 04:22:11 - Andras Lasso
You can add a GetDisplayedFrameRate() function to vtkSonixVideoSource that reads the corresponding paramvalue from the device and returns it.
You just need vtkSonixVideoSource::PrintListOfImagingParameters to get a list of all possible parameter names (you have to specify the parameter name to GetParamValue).

#### 2011-12-02, 04:30:16 - Siavash Khallaghi
Thank you Andras, I will add it tomrrow. I just wanted to make sure that it is not already implemented.

#### 2011-12-21, 19:49:57 - Tamas Heffter
Guys, 
I've added a new script but not sure it's perfect. First of all it always updates to the latest code, and configure it. However, if we want to run the Nightly test it will update to the latest revision first, than revert to the version what need for nightly test. Also, if it couldn't configure/build the project it doesn't say anything yet (because if the itk/vtk git checkout fails it would report an error). Finally if we have local modifications, probably it will merge them if it can. 
What do you think, should I add an option like --no-update and exit/report an error if the PlusBuild failed? 

#### 2011-12-22, 16:20:09 - Tamas Heffter
status: changed from "Accepted" to "Test"

#### 2011-12-22, 19:47:18 - Andras Lasso
If the script name is 'updateBuildAndTest.bat' then I would assume that it updates everything. However, I think currently  it doesn't update the PlusBuild directory. Is it intentional?

If not, then please add an update command for the PlusBuild directory as well. You can call an update using CTest:
ctest.exe -D <Config>Update

e.g.,
'c:\\Program Files (x86)\\CMake 2.8\\bin\\ctest.exe' -D ContinuousUpdate

Probably it requires an extra ctest config file at PlusBuild level.

#### 2011-12-22, 20:02:30 - Tamas Heffter
If you check the PlusBuild cmake file, you will see that it always updates the PlusBuild folder if the local revision is not equal to server revision. Is it enough or do I need to add this update too?


#### 2011-12-22, 20:14:29 - Andras Lasso
Is it updated every time you build Plus? Doing an update when you run a build step only is a bit confusing. I don't always want to do an update when I start a build. Sometimes I just want to rebuild an older Plus version.

How can we build an older Plus version?

#### 2011-12-22, 20:35:59 - Tamas Heffter
This is just updates the trunk/PlusBuild folder when you run the PlusBuild, not PlusLib or PlusApp. The current PlusBuild will check out the latest codes anyway. 
If you need an older version just set PLUS_SVN_REVISION which will check out the desired one. The backward compatibility is another question, the latest PlusBuild should configure the older versions. 
Do you think I should add an option (with default on) where we could turn of this auto update function? 

#### 2011-12-22, 20:59:47 - Andras Lasso
The problem is that you perform update in the build step. It can lead to all kinds of complications. By adding one more configuration option wouldn't really resolve this issue and would increase the complexity.

Just move the update code into the generated batch file. Either move the code that is currently in the PlusBuild CMakeLists.txt to the batch file; or use CTest to do the update. CTest may be somewhat better in the sense that the version you have to update to is determined automatically for the selected configuration (it doesn't do anything for experimental, updates to the latest version for continuous, updates to last night's version for nightly), and probably it's somewhat simpler (one line of code + a ctest config file).

Ok, then I think we misunderstood each other. That was the main goal of this ticket. We always have to ask everybody to updates their PlusBuild library whenever we made some changes. If I remove this part, we will have the same problem. Can we discuss it over skype?

Running the UpdateBuildAndTest.bat shall do an update, that's clear, as 'Update' is included in the name.

A build step shall not include an update step. As I understand, the current implementation performs update when you actually do a build. This shouldn't happen.

## #400 Failed to read metafile after editing the header 
After I've added a few lines to the metafile header file, I couldn't read it again. You can reproduce the error by running the vtkMetaImageSequenceIOTest with the two attachements:
vtkMetaImageSequenceIOTest.exe --input-img-seq-file-name=c:\\devel\\PlusBuild-bin\\PlusLib\\data\  estImages\\USTC_FrameGrabber_ProbeRotationData_modified.mha  --output-img-seq-file-name=output.mha


[ERROR]   [000.108000]  Cannot uncompress the pixel data [in ..\\..\\..\\PlusLib\\src\\PlusCommon\\vtkMetaImageSequenceIO.cxx(335)]
[ERROR]   [000.119000]  Couldn't read sequence metafile: c:\\devel\\PlusBuild-bin\\PlusLib\\data\  estImages\\USTC_FrameGrabber_ProbeRotationData.mha [in ..\\..\\..\\..\\PlusLib\\src\\ImageAcquisition\  esting\\vtk
MetaImageSequenceIOTest.cxx(67)]

#### 2011-12-05, 04:55:40 - Andras Lasso
In the attached USTC_FrameGrabber_ProbeRotationData_modified.mha file all the LF (0x0A) characters were replaced by CR/LF (0x0D/0x0A) characters. This corrupted the compressed image stream.

When a sequence metafile is manually edited make sure that the line ending is not modified (at least not in the image stream).

## #404 Display US probe position model relative to the image
Currently the probe model may be displayed at incorrect position if the ProbeModelToProbe transform transform in the config file is not up-to-date. Getting the ProbeModelToProbe transform would require custom landmark registration, which may be difficult to perform for an average user.

Proposed solution:
-display tool coordinate frames (using vtkToolAxesActor)
-if the system is calibrated then displaying the probe model as well, in a position relative to the image slice position (to make the transducer surface visible on the image aligned with the transducer surface on the probe model)


#### 2011-12-07, 23:51:35 - hussam.ashab
In my config file I cannot find ProbeModelToProbe. Where I have to import it.

#### 2011-12-08, 01:09:06 - Andras Lasso
What you have to change is the ModelToToolTransform in the <Tool Name='Probe' Type='Probe' ...> element. For now you can just experimentally adjust the values to get a nice alignment.

#### 2011-12-08, 03:36:40 - Tamas Ungi
We already have an implementation in fCal to solve this problem. Could we extract the CalibrationPhantomModel-To-Phantom registration as an independent function to be able to compute any other ToolModel-To-Tool registration? This could work with probe, needle, surgical drilling machine, etc. any tool.

There is nothing to invent, everything is ready. There are landmark points defined in the config file for the model (8 points in fCal), and they are highlighted as red dots on a grey model in fCal as you touch them with a stylus one-by-one.

Maybe it could be a separate tab in fCal, called ToolCalibration. Although it is a very low priority suggestion, because it works already the same way in Slicer, so everybody can just use Slicer for tool calibration.



#### 2011-12-08, 04:05:24 - Andras Lasso
Tamas, the plan is to display the model relative to the image (and not relative to the probe marker). This way there is no need for landmark registration, you just need to mark one point in the image (the transducer crystal array center). Also, there is no need to re-register if the marker on the probe is displaced.

The old method will still remain available.

#### 2011-12-08, 05:30:47 - Tamas Ungi
Hmm... interesting idea.
You have to be careful with this. A wrong image calibration will put the probe model in a wrong place, but creates the impression that everything is OK. With the old (currently used) method, the independent calibrations of the model and the image could reveal valuable information when one of them was wrong. Or reassured that both were good when they lined up nicely.

And having two solutions for the same thing at the same time feels suspicious. (You said we will have this new and the old one too.) We definitely need the old one for tools that are not ultrasound probes.

#### 2011-12-08, 14:47:49 - Tamas Heffter
Tamas is right, we won't notice if the calibration was wrong if we just use the crystal center to align probe model. I like the idea where we can register models to markers for any tools, it could be a new feature in a later release. 

#### 2011-12-08, 15:32:26 - Andras Lasso
With the new renderer widget you can display a model linked to any coordinate frame in the repository, so you can still link a probe model to the probe coordinate frame. This ticket is about computing a new coordinate frame, TransducerCenter: origin is the transducer center, axes orientations aligned to image slice, unit is mm. By the way, this is the same (or a similar) coordinate frame that Ultrasonix uses as their 'Probe' coordinate system.

I wouldn't add anything to fCAL that is already easily available in Slicer. A tutorial to describe how to do it in Slicer would be very useful though => added ticket #406.

We can decide to either fix this ticket or write a tutorial for Plus-1.4.0.

#### 2011-12-08, 15:32:44 - Tamas Ungi
My point is that it's already implemented. We call it Phantom registration, but who says it has to be a 'phantom'. It could be any other tool with the exact same method and interface. I haven't looked at the code, but it must be feasible with minimal changes. The current 'Phantom registration' tab could be called 'Tool registration', and you could select all tools from a drop-down menu. That drop-down menu and some logic behind it is all we need for this.


#### 2011-12-08, 15:56:42 - Csaba Pinter
Yes, I already thought about having a toolbox like that, but the bottomline of that discussion back then was that fCal is an application for a specific purpose, and this feature would be something out of scope a little. And once we have one feature like this, nothing can stop fCal running riot.

It wouldn't be too difficult implementing it by the way, that's right, so if we decide otherwise, it can be done.

About showing a wrong calibration result...can't we judge it quite well looking at the errors? It's not the same as looking at the image and the probe independently calibrated, but it is less work anyway (we have to register each probe: the L14-5 with the DRB each time the marker moves, the one with GPS, the EC, etc.)

## #406 Create a tutorial that describes how to perform landmark registration
To display a model of a tool or phantom in the correct position relative to a tracker sensor you need to determine the transform between the STL model coordinate system and the sensor coordinate system. This can be sone touching a few points on the real-life object and marking the same points on the model and perform a landmark registration. We need a step-by-step tutorial that describes how to do it.

As we have been discussing it url:https://www.assembla.com/spaces/plus/messages/1789603|here, I'll implement this in fCal, so the users can decide whether they need the lightweight standalone application for broadcasting, or this (if they also want to do something else than broadcasting).

In Plus we already have a command-line OpenIGTLink server, an OpenIGTLink client with GUI, the broadcaster, and we plan to have a server with GUI.

This is clearly too much so instead of adding it to fCal as well I think we should completely remove OpenIGTLink support from fCal.

#### 2012-06-28, 21:26:35 - Andras Lasso
After discussion with Csaba the conclusion is:
* Remove OpenIGTLink broadcasting from the Data collector
* Remove the SendTo... elements from the config files

## #413 problem with timestamps when using faketracker on Sonix RP
I am using TrackedUltrasoundCapturing together with the vtkSonixPortaVideoSource to collect data from 3D probe. I am running everything on a RP machine without any tracker attached to it. I have faketracker as my tracking device. Here is my xml configuration file:

<PlusConfiguration version='1.4'>

        />
  </DataCollection>
</PlusConfiguration>

Basically when vtkDataCollectorHardwareDevice is asked to give a timestamp of the last saved image, it goes over all tools. There is no problem with timestamp of the videosource. However, since the trackingEnabled is true, it goes over tools defined in the tracker and then cannot find the latest timestamp. I realized the trakcer is enabled in the readConfiguration regardless of the type being faketracker. Here is two main error I get. I also attached the log file.

121511_134538.984 [WARNING] [029.258000]  Unable to get timestamp from default tool tracker buffer with UID: 18446744073709551615 [in ..\\..\\..\\PlusLib\\src\\DataCollection\\vtkDataCollectorHardwareDevice.cxx(731)]

Additionally, I tried everything with SonixVideoSource and an available xml file which uses fake tracker and got the same error.

It is almost certain that the cause of this error is that PivotCalibration mode of FakeTracker only supports two tools, a Reference and a stylus, and when it tries to update the third one, it does not find information about it.
The tracking part should look like this:



~~~~

<Tracker Type='FakeTracker' BufferSize='1000' Frequency='50' LocalTimeOffset='0.0' Mode='PivotCalibration' AveragedItemsForFiltering='20' >
    <Tool Name='Reference' PortName='0' />
    <Tool Name='Stylus' PortName='1' Model='Example' />
</Tracker>


~~~~



By the way, TrackedUltrasoundCapturing is not supported any more, I even removed it from the repository today.
From now on, fCal is supposed to be used for capturing. Using it is very similar: you start fCal, connect to a device set in the toolbox that is selected by default, go to the second toolbox (Capturing), start, stop, save.

I hope I could help!

By the way, if you don't want to acquire any tracking data then you can simply set tracker mode to 'None'. Like <Tracker Type='None' />

## #414 Warn user if image to probe calibration error is too high
Just like in iCal, fCal should notify the user about too big errors.
Display a warning if the error is between 1.0 and 2.0 mm and an error if bigger than 2.0 mm (it is basically useless then)

The *vtkDataCollectorHardwareDevice* works fine on its own, but when the sector size is changed, then the received frame size and the buffer size do not match.

Maybe I am using vtkDataCollectorHardwareDevice in a way that I am not supposed to. I am guessing that maybe I should use dataCollector->GetVideoSource()->StartRecording() and StopRecording() instead of Start() and Stop().

#### 2011-12-20, 12:08:39 - Andras Lasso
Changing frame size during data collection is currently not supported in Plus. We were thinking about implementing it, but we didn't have any specific application in mind and also it was unclear how to process, use, and store data with varying frame size in general. Also, for the Ultrasonix scanners I think the frame counting was reset to 0 whenever we changed the frame size, so the timestamp filtering was also impacted.

Do you have a couple of different image streams (e.g., a full-frame low-FPS stream and one or more reduced-sector-size high-FPS stream)? How would you like to process and store these different streams? Are the number and properties (frame size, custom transform) of these streams are constant during a recording session (don't change between DataCollector->Start and ->Stop)?

I see these design options to acquire image data with different frame sizes:
* If the received pixel data is smaller than the buffer size then copy it inside the buffer => quite simple to implement, but slight performance and memory waste
* Stop and start data collection after each frame size change => no PlusLib code change is needed, but the overhead of this may not be acceptable, depending on how frequently you need to change the frame size, 
* Implementing support for multiple constant streams. It could be useful for interleaved acquisition of high-FPS/low-FPS imaging data, biplane or multi-plane probes, and motorized probes. =>  would be a nice and generic solution, but it would add some complexity to PlusLib and implementation workload is probably several weeks

Hi Andras,

Thank you for your comments. Let me explain my situation here. What we are trying to do is to capture all of the data throughout a biopsy procedure. This means that we have three different image streams, one high FPS RF image with 50% sector size, one low FPS RF image with 100% sector size and bmode images whenever we are not acquiring RF.

Right now we have buffer size issues whenever we switch from bmode to RF and also whenever we change the sector size of the RF image.

Resorting to connect and disconnect is the last thing that I want to do, since it will introduce additional delays to the system. What I would like to do is to add a custom function, similar to vtkSonixVideoSource::InternalConnect() which changes the frame size and pixel type. Basically, whenever the sector size is changed the frame size and pixel type are updated. Before I start developing, I would like to ask you if you have any suggestions.

#### 2012-01-06, 04:54:53 - Andras Lasso
I would suggest then to have a separate video stream object for each stream in vtkPlusVideoSource (similarly to the tracker, which contains a separate stream for each tracker tool: std::map<std::string, vtkTrackerTool*>).
The video stream object would need to contain a vtkVideoBuffer* and some other members, such as frame rate, frame number, etc.
vtkSonixVideoSource::AddFrameToBuffer would determine which stream the new frame belongs to and would add it to that stream.
Each stream would be saved into files separately (as the frame size and pixel type within a single file is constant).
The streams (stream name, acquisition type, sector size, etc.) should be described in the config xml.

#### 2012-01-06, 23:40:01 - Siavash Khallaghi
So basically a new class (let's call it vtkSonixStreams) that would inherit from vtkPlusVideoSource and will have three different streams, i.e. something like the following?



~~~~


class vtkSonixStreams: public vtkPlusVideoSource
{
public:
 vtkVideoBuffer* buffer1;
 vtkVideoBuffer* buffer2;
 vtkVideoBuffer* buffer3;

 //Other relevant information for each stream, e.g. frame rate, pixel size,...

protected:
 PlusStatus AddNewFrameToSpecificBuffer( int  );
}


~~~~



and the implementation of AddNewFrameToSpecificBuffer would be the following?



~~~~


PlusStatus vtkSonixStreams::AddNewFrameToSpecificBuffer(int bufferNumber ) //bufferNumber goes from 1 to 3
{
 switch (bufferNumber)
 {
  case 1:
  //Set frame size, buffer and pixel type for the first buffer (bmode)
  //Call AddFrameToBuffer
  return PLUS_SUCCESS;  

  case 2:
  //Set frame size, buffer and pixel type for the second buffer (50% RF sector size)
  //Call AddFrameToBuffer
  return PLUS_SUCCESS;
  
  case 3:
  //Set frame size, buffer and pixel type for the third buffer (100% RF sector size)
  //Call AddFrameToBuffer
  return PLUS_SUCCESS;

  case else:
  LOG_ERROR( 'Could not write new frame to specific buffer!' );
  return PLUS_FAIL;
 }
}


~~~~






#### 2012-01-06, 23:50:38 - Siavash Khallaghi
After five minutes of looking at what I wrote, I really feel that this is not what you mean. Forgive me but I am very confused.

#### 2012-01-10, 06:20:15 - Andras Lasso
vtkPlusVideoSource could be extended to handle multiple streams like this:

struct StreamInfo
{
  float FrameRate;
  int FrameCount;
  unsigned long FrameNumber; 
  double FrameTimeStamp;
  vtkVideoBuffer *Buffer;
  VideoBufferItem *CurrentVideoBufferItem; 
  US_IMAGE_ORIENTATION UsImageOrientation; 
}

class VTK_EXPORT vtkPlusVideoSource : public vtkImageAlgorithm
{
public:
  virtual PlusStatus SetFrameSize(int x, int y, int streamIndex=0);
  virtual int* GetFrameSize(int streamIndex=0);
  virtual PlusStatus SetPixelType(PlusCommon::ITKScalarPixelType pixelType, int streamIndex=0);
...
protected:
  std::vector<StreamInfo> VideoStreams;
...
}

---

Then the video source the implementation would be something like this:

PlusStatus vtkSonixVideoSource::AddFrameToBuffer(void* dataPtr, int type, int sz, bool cine, int frmnum) 
{
  int streamIndex=GetStreamIndex(type, sz, cine, frmnum);
  if (streamIndex<0 || streamIndex>...)
  {
    error...
  }
  return AddFrameToBuffer(dataPtr, type, sz, cine, frmnum, streamIndex) ;
}

PlusStatus vtkSonixVideoSource::AddFrameToBuffer(void* dataPtr, int type, int sz, bool cine, int frmnum, int streamIndex) 
{
  add the frame to the streamIndex-th stream
}

Possible solutions:
* Change the way the recognized point is selected from the area. Make it optional: maximum, weighed average, etc.
* Make the phantom bigger
** Put the third NWire on the upper layer, this way the phantom itself can be the same, but we gain 5 mm
** Build a new bigger phantom
* Improve image quality so that the images of the wires appear smaller (less chance of error in determining the actual wire position)
* Perform the calibration in the region where the target organ is located: the prostate we image during procedure is about 5 cm deep, so if we perform the calibration so that the wires are in that region, the resulting minimum calibration error applies to the target instead of an increased error due to different depths

Adding more wire layers or move them farther from each other would probably also improve the accuracy (may need to increase the height of the fCal phantom for this).

It could be also interesting to try calibrating with multiple cross-wires (intersection position could be estimated by interpolation, assuming the transducer motion is smooth), although that probably limited to work with freehand motion (not with a stepper).

After trying to reproduce the issue, I analyzed the recorded dataset for the fCal 2.0 phantom with 3 N-wires and observed a very accurate calibration with almost no tilt.

Suggested follow-up step is to see if we can produce Y independent calibrations with similar accuracy.

With fcal 2.0 I usually get calibration errors well below 1mm, typically about 0.5mm. So, I agree that we can close this.

#### 2012-10-22, 23:38:16 - Tamas Ungi
Just a question out of curiosity. Did you set soundvelocity=1490?


#### 2012-10-22, 23:39:55 - Csaba Pinter
I didn't set anything like that. Just used the config file in the installer and went through the calibration steps.

#### 2012-10-22, 23:40:40 - Andras Lasso
I haven't changed anything, just used the SonixTouch with the default config file.

#### 2012-10-22, 23:44:40 - Tamas Ungi
Aha, but the scaling is not uniform right? So the scaling in NF direction could compensate for the lower sound velocity in water (compared to the default 1540 set in Ultrasonix). This will not work so well for the curved probe, only if you set the sound velocity right. But it doesn't mean you cannot close the ticket. Just a note.

#### 2012-10-22, 23:48:13 - Andras Lasso
Interestingly, I got <0.5mm error with the curvilinear probe, calibrated in water, using the fcal 2.0 phantom, reproduced a couple of times. The error was computed only near the center of the image (where the middle fiducial wire was), so maybe on the sides (where there is more distortion) the error would have been higher.

#### 2012-10-22, 23:49:37 - Csaba Pinter
We should set the sound velocity to 1490 in the example config files then.

## #421 Create a sequence metafile importer for 3D Slicer
Slicer currently imports sequence metafile as a single 3D volume. It would be better to import that as a 2D+t sequence of frames. It could be implemented by a custom data IO module that detects if a sequence metafile is attempted to be loaded and it loads it as a time bundle of single-slice volumes. Prerequisite: need to have good support for time bundles in 3D Slicer (for images and transforms).

## #422 Request to add method to access protected 'Buffer' in vtkPlusVideoSource
We need to dynamically update and change the vtkPlusVideoBuffer but after InternalConnect() is called. This is a different issue than ticket #415.
We propose the following three solutions:

1. Make the vtkVideoBuffer *Buffer defined in line 281 vtkPlusVideoSource public.
2. Add a Set/Get macro to access this protected member.
3. Add a new method to vtkPlusVideoSource:



~~~~


PlusStatus UpdateInternalBuffer( vtkVideoBuffer *newBuffer )
{
this->Buffer = newBuffer;
return PlusSuccess;
}


~~~~



We are under a time constraint in our project. We just need consent to implement either of the three solutions. We would appreciate it if you don't propose an extension of vtkPlusVideoSource using the VTK_EXPORT macro.

#### 2012-01-21, 04:47:12 - Andras Lasso
Get/Set method is OK. Make sure you don't leak memory (delete old buffer 
when you set the new one) and pay attention to thread-safety.

#### 2012-01-25, 08:08:43 - Siavash Khallaghi
Hi Andras,

I am trying to fill the gaps in my knowledge and I was reading for the past couple of hours. I hope you don't mind me asking,  so please correct me if I am wrong:

1. The vtkPlusVideoSource's internal Buffer is a smart pointer. Smart pointers have a reference count that is equal to the number of pointers that point to the same object.
2. When the reference count reaches zero, the smart pointer (i.e. Buffer) is deleted.
3. Buffer->Unregister() decreases the reference count by one. (I am not quite sure about this)
4. After this->Buffer = NewBuffer, the number of pointers that point to the same object is increased, so we need to increase the reference count by one, so we do Buffer->Register(). (Again I am not sure about this one)


#### 2012-01-25, 14:22:52 - Andras Lasso
1. The vtkPlusVideoSource's internal Buffer is not a smart pointer, but a simple pointer to a reference counted object. To create a smart pointer you have to use the vtkSmartPointer class: vtkSmartPointer<vtkVideoBuffer> is a smart pointer.

2. When you delete a smart pointer it decreases the reference count of the object that it points to. When the reference count in the refcounted object reaches zero then the refcounted object is deleted from the memory.

3. Yes, Buffer->Unregister() does exactly the same as Buffer->Delete(): decreases the reference count by one.

4. We have to call Buffer->Register() after this->Buffer = NewBuffer, because we want to keep the buffer object alive, even if it is not used any more by any other objects. This pattern is used in VTK almost every time when you create an object and set it as an input of another object:
  x->New();
  y->SetX(x);
  x->Delete();
With the usage of smart pointers it is much nicer and safer (this is the recommended method):
  vtkSmartPointer<vtkX> x=vtkSmartPointer<vtkX>::New();
  y->SetX(x)).

## #426 Support volume reconstruction of float data
caitlins reported getting an error 'scalar types of the input and output do not match' when trying to reconstruct float image

#### 2012-02-07, 14:46:06 - Andras Lasso
'I was able to cast my data to shorts, to solve the problem with using floats, though I still have to change the output constructor to VTK SHORT.' => see https://www.assembla.com/spaces/plus/messages/1519553

I've made a few changes to the Volume Reconstructor in order to fix #285 (I believe some having to deal with data types), so I wonder if this may possibly have been fixed as well? Is there a way we could test it?

#### 2012-03-02, 16:35:30 - Andras Lasso
You can create a float volume in 3D Slicer: Open a non-float volume. Use the 'Cast Scalar Volume' module to create a float or double volume. Save the volume.

Slicer ignores the custom metadata fields that describe the pose for each frame. So, you have to copy the custom fields from the original (non-float) volume's header to the new (float/double) volume's header.

Showing the wires in 3d is enough. The only problem is that the phantom model makes it difficult to see the wires. Would it be possible to allow the user to show/hide the phantom model?

#### 2012-06-27, 22:56:26 - Csaba Pinter
You mean in run-time? Like a toggle button for it?

#### 2012-06-27, 23:04:49 - Andras Lasso
Yes, run-time. It's not trivial, because adding one more button to the GUI just for this use case might be too much.

#### 2012-06-27, 23:30:58 - Csaba Pinter
I'm thinking about a drop-down menu for the 'show 3d objects' button where the user could toggle the objects that are defined in the Rendering configuration element. As that button is for showing objects, this could be an extension for it, and every user would find it immediately without specifically looking for it.

#### 2012-06-28, 14:37:25 - Adam Rankin
That would be very clean and add even more meaning to the '3d objects' button. The grouping of all actions related to 3d views will make it more consistent for the user.

## #429 Simulated US (graphics card independent, working in ITK)
working version by NAMIC week, integration with PLUS during NAMIC week

#### 2012-02-17, 22:49:33 - Andras Lasso
We may use either ITK or VTK. The important thing is that it if GPU is used then the GPU framework of ITK or VTK shall be used (to avoid developing, testing, and maintaining redundant GPU related utility functions, building, packaging, etc.). There is a GPU framework in ITK4 already (http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK_Release_4/GPU_Acceleration). Maybe something is also available in VTK. If the GPU support in ITK/VTK is immature then we should not use GPU acceleration yet and just go with a CPU-only implementation.


#### 2012-04-12, 14:01:37 - Elvis Chen
see below for ITK/OpenCL status.

As many of us know, one major difficulty in GPGPU coding is the memory management, i.e. transfer the data cross the CPU/GPU boundary.  This requires a lot of helper-class (which are problem-independent) and really should be done at the base architecture level.

I am afraid that if I start migrating my simulate US CUDA code to ITK/OpenCL, a lot of what I will be doing will be obsolete when ITK 4.2 is out.  Perhaps we should hold this project until ITK4.2 is out?

to Rick, insight-users 
Rick, 

OpenCL is currently slated for the 4.2 release of ITK this June.

The underlying components have been submitted to our code review system.  We'll be clearing this backlog of patches in the coming months that were submitted while we were preparing the 4.1 release.

OpenCL support will include the underlying architecture to transparently transfer images from main memory to the GPU and a set of example filters of a variety archetypes (pixel filters, neighborhood filter, finite different filters, etc.).

## #430 Enable fCal with pre-calibrated tools
If the stylus tooltip is very close to the sensor or an internal calibration makes the sensor appear very close to the tooltip then the current pivot calibration doesn't work, because it doesn't collect points if they are too close to each other.

Change the pivot calibration algo so that it checks not only the similarity of the point positions but also the orientation.

It would be also nice to be able to bypass the pivot calibration (with an identity or whatever matrix that is already specified in the config file). Maybe it's possible to do that already.


#### 2012-02-17, 22:32:43 - Csaba Pinter
If you don't do the pivot calibration then fCal uses the one it finds in the configuraiton file.
The orientation checking I'll add soon.

## #432 Visualize RF data in fCal

#### 2012-06-28, 15:50:27 - Andras Lasso
The signal waveform display would be useful, but it should be displayed in addition to the B-mode image. The B-mode image display would be needed to make sure that the acquired RF data is correct (the waveform display cannot provide that info).

## #433 SonixVideoSource should clip unused image margins
There are black image margins on the ultrasound images, not used for anything. They are not nice and take up space when we store images. If there is a way to get the useful image region through Ulterius, then the rest should be clipped. Image origin would be placed in the useful image corner.
If there is no reliable way to get the useful rectangle through Ulterius, the clipping rectangle should be given in the config file.

re #433: Reverted Ultrasonix image clipping.

Implementation is more complicated than other image sources due to multi-channel implementation. Clipping should be implemented in the Video source base class. That would take care of Ultrasonix and it would allow removing non-hardware clipping from other video sources (e.g., ICCapturing).

## #435 Detect probe orientation automatically when an asymmetric wire pattern is used
fCal_1.0_Wiring_1.0 is symmetric, therefore there is no way to tell if the probe is rotated 180deg.  fCal_1.2_Wiring_1.1 has an asymmetric wire pattern, so it should be possible to determine the wire labels automatically, regardless of the orientation of the probe. However, it should be tested that the labeling really works correctly for any probe orientation. Once the display of the wire names in the segmentation dialog box is completed (#308) then this functionality can be tested easily. If the labeling is correct only for a certain probe orientation then the labeling algorithm shall be improved so that it works for all probe orientations.

## #436 Improve Image Quality of Hole-Filling
Hole filling works, but it does not produce a high quality reconstruction. Known issues include:
* Holes that are big are not filled
* There is often blockiness around hole edges
* Interpolation could take into account distance from the origin voxel, slice orientation

I've implemented a rough initial version that uses Gaussian weights, and I've tested it on the 3nwire1 dataset. I've included a screenshot to allow for some comparisons, and will commit once I've run a few more tests.

Clarifying Edit: In the attached screenshot, the 'Pasting Slices Only' uses only every 5 slices of the original dataset. The two panes on the right show hole filling using 3x3x3 neighborhood. The Ground truth is the result of pasting all available slices without any skipping. All images are of the 3nwire1 dataset.

> Should we have some kind of quality metric to compare reconstruction results (from a reduced dataset) against a ground truth (densely pasted slices from a full dataset)? 

This would be important for any serious testing/comparison of different methods.

I would use simulated sequences (that are acquired by extracting image slices from synthetic volumes). Contact Laura Bartha about the simulator, as she is going to develop one. You may use what she has (probably not much yet) and/or help her developing something that would be useful for this testing.

(In r:1568) re #436 Implemented variable kernel size. Kernels now have to be specified whenever hole filling is turned on.

#### 2012-03-23, 22:27:17 - Andras Lasso
Please add a test that does volume reconstruction with hole filling. It will help to make sure that hole filling remain functional and will also serve as an example.

What about the hole filling test we already have in place? The one that apparently just failed (which I will upload a fix for hopefully very soon)?

#### 2012-03-23, 22:50:24 - Andras Lasso
If there is at least one working test/example (with a kernel definition in the config file) then it’s enough.

#### 2012-03-23, 22:53:00 - Thomas Vaughan
I think the lack of a kernel definition is probably why the test failed. I'm testing it now, and I'll upload an updated config file once I confirm it fixes the problem.

#### 2012-03-23, 23:06:36 - Andras Lasso
Also make sure that in case of a missing or invalid kernel definition the algorithm logs an error message explaining what is the problem then fails gracefully. Document the meaning of the kernel parameters in the algorithm header.

(In r:1690) Re #436: Added additional functionality to the volume reconstructor

New functionality:
- There are now two kinds of Gaussian kernels, GAUSSIAN and GAUSSIAN_ACCUMULATION. The former does not use the accumulation buffer as an additional weight, whereas the latter does.
- Sticks kernels will now take a 'NumberOfSticksToUse' parameter in the config file which defines how many sticks should be used in calculating the final value of a voxel. The value will be a weighted average over the results of N sticks (weight = distance).

Bug fixes:
- Gaussian kernels would fill holes with random values when it failed

## #437 Limit the number of candidates in wire patter recognition
On a Sonix Touch machine when the calibration phantom wire pattern is being analysed in real time, and accidentally a lot of reflection is present on the image (e.g. reflection from the bottom of the water tank), the program freezes for a very long time (about a minute). This is probably due to the large number of wire candidates being analysed. In these images, the true wires won't be recognized anyway, so could we just drop the images (or not try wire pattern recognition) when the number of candidates exceed a certain limit?

## #439 OpenIGTLinkBroadcaster should send full transform names
Right now, the ProbeToReference transform is sent to Slicer under the device name 'Probe'. Also, it's easier to identify MRML nodes in Slicer if we add 'Transform' to transform nodes. So the device name should be 'ProbeToReferenceTransform' and 'StylusTipToReferenceTransform' for the needle.

## #440 Pattern recognition fails on good-looking image when MinDotSize is small
Although the candidates are apparently good (all the wires are among the candidates), the pattern recognition fails no matter the pattern recognition related parameters. But when increasing the minimum dot size (MorphologicalOpeningCircleRadiusMm) parameter (eg from 0.27 to 0.47), the pattern is well recognized, even if the candidates seem to remain the same.

Sample images are needed and the pattern recognition debugged to find out why does this happen.

#### 2012-03-10, 17:25:35 - Andras Lasso
(In r:1535) fixed #440: Fixed the problem of not detecting the pattern from a valid set of fiducial candidates (the allowed shift between the fiducial lines was not computed correctly).

## #441 Drop-Down Menu for Calibration File in FCal is not Obvious
It is not obvious that the white text box in fcal is actually a drop down box. With the 'edit' button next to it, it appears to be an editable field, and it is not clear for what. The box should be scaled such that the 'drop-down arrow' is visible.

#### 2012-04-04, 19:52:42 - Csaba Pinter
It has been a subject of debate for a long time :)
A: The drop-down arrow is not visible but the device set names are
B: The arrow is visible but only parts of the device set name can be seen (this way the drop-down window is restricted to the same width as the box itself)

#### 2012-04-04, 20:15:07 - Andras Lasso
I would vote for B (seeing the arrow). Seeing the arrow is important, as without that you don't realize it's a listbox. Seeing a few more character from the device name does not make a big difference (and it should be possible to display the full name of the selected device set in another textbox or as a tooltip or some other way).

#### 2012-04-04, 21:35:07 - Tamas Heffter
Is there any way to customize the dropdown box? If so, we could move the arrow to the left side and it would solve the problem. 
The tooltip is already enabled, but it would be really painful to choose the right config file if we have 20 in the list.  

#### 2012-04-05, 01:51:53 - Csaba Pinter
I tried a lot of things when I put that combobox there and it seems it's not customizable in that sense. I decided to do this way because back then the toolbox was considerably narrower, and that way the short device set names looked really bad (few characters at the beginning, then '...' and few characters at the end). Maybe now that it's wider, it would look better.
I'll try it tomorrow and put two screenshot here so you can vote.

Often we don't know the Image-to-Probe matrix, so then it cannot be included in the config file. I think what is needed is to display this fact on the fCal application GUI, and maybe disable some functions that don't make sense without this calibration matrix. E.g. volume reconstruction.

## #445 Collection of multiple tracked ultrasound sequences should be possible by using a foot pedal only
If there is an operator for the US machine who is collecting multiple image sets using the foot pedal, and an operator for the computer who is moving the mouse in order to save data, it can take extra time to re-set the focus for the foot pedal for each experiment. It might be beneficial to have the focus remain even after the mouse moves.

Also, it's not very convenient that each saved image sequence in fCal has to be named manually. At least file name should be generated automatically (e.g., adding _<number> postfix; SpineRecon_1.mha, SpineRecon_2.mha, ...), so that the user can just press enter when he is prompted for file name.

The ideal workflow would be something like this:
* set capturing parameters, file name, etc.
* start capturing by pressing the foot pedal
* pause/resume capturing any number of times by pressing the foot pedal
* save sequence by pressing another foot pedal (or use a combination of pedal presses)
* start capturing by pressing the foot pedal...

I can add a default name for the file to be saved, that's no problem, but the focus issue is more tricky.
I tried to do it properly in other toolboxes, but once the 3D canvas gets the focus (when the user clicks there to zoom in for example), I can't get the focus back automatically. I can implement similar focus settings as in the other toolboxes but it won't be reliable.

#### 2012-03-02, 17:22:02 - Andras Lasso
Probably the user will just use the 2D view, so probably the focus setting that you can implement will be good enough.

## #447 Compounding Method as an Input to PasteSlicesInVolume
Depending on the application of the volume reconstructor, different methods of compounding may be required. Currently, compounding does a weighted average, but some applications may need maximum values or minimum values.

#### 2012-04-11, 21:47:39 - Thomas Vaughan
(In r:1611) re #447, Started implementing different calculation methods for the distribution step (ie, weighted average or maximum when pasting slices into the volume). The config file now takes a 'Calculation' element that can be either 'WEIGHTED_AVERAGE' or 'MAXIMUM'. This has only been tested for when optimization is set to FULL, Compounding is ON, and Interpolation is LINEAR, and is not likely to work with other combinations yet because support for MAXIMUM has not yet been implemented.

The XML element and code variables will be renamed to something more descriptive in my next commit.

## #448 fCal crashes on the Sonix Tablet during calibration
The Image-to-Probe calibration runs smoothly on the Sonix Tablet machine, until the Freehand Calibration workphase. When collecting images for calibration, the program crashes after a random number of images collected (100 frames was the maximum in 10 trials). The wire pattern is recognized, and the progress bar progresses a while before the crash happens. I put high priority to this ticket because the image geometry is different on the Tablet. So we have to calibrate the probes with it before we could start using them. 

#### 2012-03-08, 23:21:26 - Tamas Heffter
Tamas, did you check the memory usage? 

#### 2012-03-08, 23:23:25 - Tamas Ungi
The machine itself had plenty of memory, and the buffer size in the ImageAcquisition section of the config file was set to 50 to save on memory. I haven't done more memory checking.

#### 2012-03-08, 23:37:54 - Tamas Heffter
Try to change the log level to Trace and hopefully it will give us some hints (it's going to be really slow probably). I guess, there is no VS2008 installed on the tablet...

#### 2012-03-08, 23:59:14 - Thomas Kuiran Chen
Hi Guys, I just confirmed with my colleague here who handles the Ulterius SDK support at Ultrasonix.  The new SonixTablet is compatible with the Ulterius SDK (tested with the current stable release v5.7) because Ultrasonix only maintains one version of SDK for all hardware.  Do you have the latest SDK?  Perhaps it is related to the drivers/firmware of Tablet and/or Certus/EM tracker?

#### 2012-03-09, 03:27:36 - Tamas Ungi
Thanks for the suggestions. I have an experiment with a deadline tomorrow. After that, I will hopefully be able to generate a more detailed log.

Check if the Ascension dll-s in Plus are the same as the ones in the Ultrasonix exam software. In a SonixTouch device at Robarts the tracking with Plus didn't work with the Ascension dll-s that were in the Plus package, but it did work after overwriting them with the ones that were in the Ultrasonix directory.

#### 2012-04-05, 22:18:12 - Csaba Pinter
I did a full calibration today, and although it was very annoying that the Sonix control overlay stayed on top of everything, and was flickering, and slowing down fCal, it worked just fine. Actually, I got really nice calibration results. The 3D error on the calibration dataset was 0.49 mm. Maybe because of the temporal calibration...

I attach the logs and the config files.

The hardware has changed since we reported this issue. At that time we used an external trakSTAR, and now the GPS extension is integrated to the Tablet. Since that was a temporary solution (trakSTAR) if the calibration works with the current configuration, we shouldn't worry about it.

Regarding 'Alter to get new position? Or does it do it automatically ?'

TrackedFrame* frame = trackedFrameList->GetTrackedFrame(i);
=> reads tracked frame (including image and tracking data) into 'frame'

transformRepository->SetTransforms(*frame)
=> updates the transformRepository with all the transforms that are stored in 'frame'

## #453 Get RF and B-mode images at the same time with Ultrasonix SDK
Implement RF+BMode acquisition with the Ulterius SDK. 


Kris, 

I found the new ID in the variables.map.xml and probably it rf-mode: 
<var id='857' name='Mode (RF)' newID='rf-mode'/>

So, if I understand correctly, we should call the following function to enable the different RF modes: 

//The active RF mode. 0=B only, 1=RF only, 2=B and RF, 3=ChRF, 4=B and ChRF 
this->Ult.setParamValue( 'rf-mode',  2);

#### 2012-03-16, 22:44:42 - Tamas Heffter
We can get simultaneously BMode ang RF data by setting the Acquisition data type to udtRF | udtBPost  
sonixGrabber->SetAcquisitionDataType(udtRF | udtBPost);

The current implementation of Plus is not yet ready for handling multiple image buffers, therefore we cannot use it.
Also, we just store the AcquisitionDataType in an integer, and the ulterius getDataDescriptor function cannot handle multiple data types. 
this->Ult.getDataDescriptor((uData)this->AcquisitionDataType, this->DataDescriptor))

So the proposed solution would be to store the different acquisition data types in a list, the same way as Tracker has tools. 
- On SetAcquisitionDataType we could add all data types from the list
- We could get the data descriptor for each data type from the list
- Each data type should have their own image buffer 
- We could store the tracked frames for each data type in a separate sequence metafile 
- Either we could get all image data types in one tracked frame with multiple PlusFrame from data collector or we can have a GetTrackedFrame function for each data type.

Just out of curiosity, will this solve the biplane probe image acquisition too? Saving both streams simulataneously? If yes, the tickets should be associated.

#### 2012-03-17, 01:50:04 - Andras Lasso
Do you know if the ultrasonix hardware supports simultaneous operation of two transducers? As far as I remember when I switch between the axial/sagittal transducer there is a relay switching noise. This may indicate that although there are 3 connectors, only one transducer is connected to the processing electronics at any time.

#### 2012-03-17, 02:20:37 - Tamas Ungi
Yes, probably the biplane probe will not work both at the same time. But I remember having a discussion about parallel image streams. What was it?...
Endoscopy + US? I'm not sure.
So, if it's decided the PLUS will support multiple image streams, maybe we should have a quick brainstorming meeting.

#### 2012-03-17, 11:51:02 - Tamas Ungi
As Purang pointed out, the Ultrasonix machine alternates between the two imaging modes in RF/B mode. So the frame rate will drop to half in both, and the corresponding frames in the two streams won't be scanned at the same time. I don't know if this is a problem for the application that requires this issue fixed...

#### 2012-03-17, 13:40:44 - Andras Lasso
B-mode and RF frames are acquired one after the other. As B-mode involves more processing, the B-mode frame rate is just halved, but the RF frame rate is reduced with a higher ratio (decimated?).

#### 2012-03-17, 13:46:50 - Andras Lasso
There are many applications of multiple image streams:
* multi-plane US (using biplane or 3D probes; there are systems that supports this)
* differently processed US (RF/B-mode, ...)
* alternating image size (only a smaller sector is imaged at a high frame rate and occasionally a full sector is acquired to have an image of the full field)
* stereo endoscope
* video and US (e.g., a video camera records how the trainee inserts the needle, while we store the US images and tracking information)

#### 2012-03-18, 02:34:50 - Tamas Heffter
Tamas, we can have a brainstorming meeting anytime, just let me know what time would work for you (however, everybody could see this brainstorming so it's even better). 
Probably I'll implement the RF->BMode converter for Plus (with the help of the Ultrasonix SDK Amplio library) anyway, it would solve the frame rate dropping problem. 

So, it seems to me that we need two different requirements: 
- We should handle multiple image data types from the same device (like BMode+RF data acquisition) 
- We should be able to connect to multiple devices (like video and US)

For handling multiple data types we can have the same structure as the tracker tools, like creating a new video buffer for each datatype (and store each datatype in a separate tracked frame list). Also, the data collector could store multiple video sources (and tracker sources) by creating a map of devices. The only thing is not clear to me is how do we pair the image and tracking data if we have multiple devices? E.g. we connect to the US with the SonixVideo SDK, connect to the endoscope (another imaging device), and we track the US with the optical tracker and the endoscope with the magnetic tracker. If we want to process these images and tracking data (and store them in a tracked frame list), we need to somehow define the relationship between them (probably in the config file). Any idea? 
Also, if we have multiple data types (like BMode+RF), we can store the selected tracker data for each individual tracked frame list. 

Do you think this would fulfill all the above mentioned requirements? 



#### 2012-03-18, 14:00:24 - Tamas Ungi
OK.

I'm not sure either about how would the different video (or tracked video) sources relate to each other. I can imagine them saved to individual buffers. Then it would be the responsibility of the application to know how they are related. So we would have as many tracked frame lists as video sources, and they would go to different files.

So, if I understand well what you mean, yes.

#### 2012-03-18, 17:08:19 - Tamas Heffter
Yes, this is exactly what I meant. But when you want to get the tracked frame from the data collector, somehow you should identify the data sources (like, I need the videoSource1 and trackerSource2 in one tracked frame). 

#### 2012-03-19, 03:26:55 - Andras Lasso
In the first version I would save all available tracking data for each video stream. It's simple and we surely won't miss any data. If we find later that this leads to performance or other problems then we can introduce some filtering mechanisms (some data stored only in certain streams).

#### 2012-03-19, 13:01:46 - Tamas Ungi
i agree.

## #456 Integrate single-wall phantom calibration algorithm into Plus
It would be interesting to have the single-wall phantom calibration for computing the image plane to probe marker transform. It would allow a comparison of the multi-N and the single-wall phantom calibration results.

Elvis Chen wrote on Mar 23, 2012 that he can provide the Matlab code for the single-wall phantom calibration. He has 2 implementations of single-wall phantom calibration based on Prof. Rohling's papers. The 1st implementation was based on the original paper (i.e. iterative solution), the 2nd one is based on the closed-form solution from the 2012 SPIE paper. Both versions were implemented in MATLAB. The original paper is: Rapid Calibration for 3D Freehand Ultrasound, R.W. Prager, R.N. Rohling, A.H. Gee, and L. Berman, Ultrasound in Med.&Biol., vol. 24, no.6, pp855-869, 1998. This is a very good paper and describes everything very well. The single-wall calibration algorithm described in this paper uses an iterative solver. In his experience, it requires more than 100 images to get a stable solution, although if you collect the images carefully, my simulation suggests that about 60 images will suffice. This year in SPIE (2012) a closed-form solution was presented by: Single Wall Closed-form Differential Ultrasound Calibration, Mohammad Najafi, Narges Afsham, Purang Abolmaesumi, and Robert Rohling, SPIE Medical Imaging, 2012, San Diego. While this paper presents a closed-form solution, in practice, an iterative solver should be used to get a more robust answer. The closed-form solution will only work if the data collected are good; since this involves a pseudo inverse of a large matrix. If the data corrected were not good, then the matrix won't be full rank. The advantage of the single-wall calibration is that it is easy to perform. So while it may need a large number of images to get a solution, these images can be collected in relatively short amount of time. His implementation in matlab also has line detection algorithm (RANSAC based). Integration of it into PLUS shouldn't be too difficult provided the linear algebra part is available. For the closed-form solution, the pseudo inverse can be computed using SVD, which I already implemented in C++. On the other hand, if we want to use the iterative solver, we may have to use ITK extensively.

Integration into Plus:
* The iterative algorithm is more robust so use that
* For line detection the algorithm in the temporal calibration can be utilized (https://www.assembla.com/code/plus/subversion/nodes/trunk/PlusLib/src/CalibrationAlgo/TemporalCalibrationAlgo.cxx)
* ITK (and VNL inside ITK) can be used to compute SVD and for various linear and non-linear optimizations

Hello everyone,
I would like to clarify on the 'Single Wall Closed-form Differential Ultrasound Calibration' method. The pseudo inverse of a non-square matrix is calculated by a simple algebraic formula. {A}^-1= {(A^T*A)}^-1* A^T (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_inverse)
Therefore even if there are many rows in A, the term that is inversed is the size of the columns of A (in this case 17x17). So it is very fast and easy to compute it.
Also it is not true that the matrix is not full rank. On the contrary we always can get the result but it doesn't mean that it is not sensitive to error. In fact the problem is that with low number of images the solution is very sensitive to measurement error. One reason is perhaps the indirect calculation of the solution using substitute variables.
Since you have optimized SVD algorithms, another approach is by using SVD to solve X. I've attached a MATLAB implantation for this. It simulates 50 poses (1000 trials) by adding axial noise (normal distribution) to each column. The MATLAB implementation is very fast (0.07 s for computation of 50 poses once)

Regards,
Mohammad

Mohammad, would you be interested in integrating the algorithm into Plus and try it on real measurement data and compare its performance to the multi-N fiducial phantom?

Line detection algorithm is already available in Plus, so the work would be mainly implementing the algorithm in C/C++ using VNL numerical methods library. We could help with the integration if you have any questions.

Hi Andras,

Yes in the long run I like to do that but currently I'm working on another calibration method. Thanks, I'll ask for your help on this way.

The basic single-wall calibration seems to be very sensitive. You need to perform specific motion patterns, which is not easy to learn. Also, the result is very sensitive to the line segmentation results, so for practical use it seems to be necessary to digitization the wall plane using a tracked pointer. Altogether, it seems to be more complex and less robust than the mult-N-wire calibration. If somebody does not want to invest $50-$200 to a printed fCal phantom then calibration phantom can be built from Lego blocks (http://perk.cs.queensu.ca/contents/tracked-ultrasound-calibration-studies-phantom-made-legor-bricks).

## #457 Add temporal calibration with rotation motion
The old temporal calibration algorithm has been replaced by the correlation-based method. However, in case of the transrectal probe in a stepper there is no way to move the transducer closer/farther to a plane. Therefore, the calibration has to be supported using rotational motion.

Hi Tamas,

I made some changes and put into the 'development' branch in the repository at github.
The repository location is git://github.com/openigtlink/OpenIGTLink.git.
After cloning the repository in your local machine, please checkout 'development' branch
and you could find the new Socket class with SetReceiveTimeout() and SetSendTimeout()
functions. I left SetTimeout() function for the backward compatibility. SetTimeout() will
set timeout for both receiving and sending.

I haven't tried it on Windows yet. If you have any problem or question, please let me know.

Thanks,

About names:
* If an application works as server only or client only then we should have the 'server' or 'client' in the application name to make it clear.
* I think it would be good to include the 'OpenIGTLink' word in the name as well.
* The 'daemon' word is somewhat misleading, as it refers to a background process, while actually the server/client would be started explicitly by the user. Also the term is used on linux only. I think 'service' is more widely used.

I've created a function GetBestCorrelation() which, depending on the value of SIGNAL_ALIGNMENT_METRIC, will compute the correlation for the best fit lag index (which I now store after computing the tracker lag).

Now, in order for the threshold *comparison in GetTrackerLagSec* to be valid, the computed value would have to be normalized across all metrics. Is this possible? Can the score of SSD be compared to the score of SAD or x-correlation?

*Or I could have N different threshold values, where N is the number of metrics used by the calculation.*

Please talk/write to Eric about what metric he would recommend based on his recent experiments.

I will use the approximately 200 calibration sequences that I have collected to see if an appropriate threshold can be found. I think that it sensible that, as Adam suggested, there are different thresholds for each metric (i.e. a threshold for correlation via SSD, a threshold for correlation via SAD, etc.). Because we have found SSD to be the most effective alignment metric in practice, estimating thresholds for SSD would be top priority.

#### 2012-08-07, 16:13:55 - Adam Rankin
(In r:1976|plus:1976) Fixed #460 Temporal calibration now offers much more feedback. It will also issue a warning if the result breaks a certain threshold. The thresholds are defined per-metric alignment type.

Currently, the values are set astronomically high so that the trigger won't be hit. When a proper threshold value is determined for each metric, they can be updated in the code.

## #461 Change DataCollector design to stream based devices 
The current implementation of data collector limits the number of devices to an imaging source and to a tracking source, also the implementation of the two sources are almost identical. 

Change the current vtkPlusVideoSource and vtkTracker classes to *vtkPlusDevice* as a common interface for devices. Create a *vtkPlusDeviceFactory* class for instantiate the hardware device libraries (the hardware device libraries should inherit from the  vtkPlusDevice interface library).  Each device can have multiple streams (like BMode+RF video stream) and the DataCollector should only work with the list of streams. When the applications requests a tracked frame from the data collector,  caller needs to specify the main stream (the one we used for matching timestamps), plus additionally some arbitrary number of streams (only the transforms will be retrieved from these and merged/interpolated into the tracked frame). 
In addition, the tracker classes can have multiple tools within a stream, so we can keep the vtkTrackerTool implementation within the tracker hardware devices (maybe we could rename it to *vtkPlusStreamTool*, so each stream could have multiple tools). 

Merge the current implementation of the VideoBufferItem and TrackerBufferItem classes and use only one *StreamBufferItem* class (each stream should have an PlusVideoFrame and custom field container, plus should be ready for transform interpolation). 
Merge the current vtkVideoBuffer and vtkTrackerBuffer to *vtkPlusStreamBuffer* class with all functions (timestamp filtering, transform interpolation, etc).

#### 2012-09-26, 21:50:57 - Tamas Heffter
I just don't get the 1.7.Y diagram. After you do the vtkPlusStream, why do you need video and tracker stream again? There should be only one buffer for each stream (can be either video without tracker info, or tracker info without video data, or both), so all the current tracker and video classes could be inherited from the new vtkPlusStream and we could finally forget the tracker and video terms :-) 


#### 2012-09-26, 23:03:30 - Andras Lasso
Some thoughts...

h1. Requirements 

Use cases:
* Simultaneous RF-mode image acquisition and sending of B-mode converted RF data through OpenIGTLink
* Recording of images, potentially with different depth settings
* Simulated ultrasound image generation that corresponds to real tracking data
* Simultaneous acquisition of EM tracker and optical data for tracker validation
* Interleaved acquisition of full frames between continuous high-frame-rate acquisition of small-sector images
* Acquisition of stereo video data

Current devices:
* MicronTracker: provides two video streams (the left and right camera) and multiple tool tracking
* Ultrasonix: provides multiple video streams (e.g, one for each depth, sector size, B-mode/RF image type, for each transducer of a biplane probe) and optionally a tracking stream (when using a motorized transducer)
* Simulator: uses a stream as input that contains tracking data; provides an output stream that contains the same tracking data and corresponding simulated image
* Simple tracker and video sources

h1. Potential design 

* Stream: For each timestamp one stream may contain a sequence video frame and/or a number of transforms. A stream stores not just the latest data but at least a couple of seconds (to allow other devices to retrieve data before it is overwritten and allow interpolation). Streams are basically input/output ports of devices. Each stream is identified by its string ID.
* Device: Each device is independent, has its own thread. Each device can pull data from a hardware device or any defined streams (provided by other devices). Devices may own one or more streams, these are the output streams of the device. Devices acquire data and maintain their own internal buffers. Challenge: how to avoid actually copying the pixel data when multiple device refer to the same frame. Potential solution: have a shared list to that stores the pixels of video frames, using reference counting; need to pay attention to avoid memory reallocation, minimize the overhead due to locking, blocking the acquisition in a fast device because a slower device is still processing the output of the fast device, ...). Dynamic behavior of devices: For the sake of simplicity, the input and output streams for each device are defined statically in the config file, they cannot be changed during runtime. Devices may be started/stopped producing output at any time.
* DataCollector: To generalize the datacollector, which currently mixes data of 1 tracking-only and 1 video stream we can define virtual devices. Virtual devices perform the data interpolation and mixing tasks of the datacollector by combining or augmenting existing streams (actually, the simulator device is already such a device). We can keep a singleton DataCollector to instantiate and configure the devices based on the device set config file. The DataCollector could also serve as a central registry that devices could use to declare their own output streams and to retrieve data from other streams.

Virtual (software) devices:
* Mixer: mixes tracking data from multiple streams with one image stream; performs the matching and interpolation tracking data to video data (currently implemented in datacollector)
* Disk storage: stores the input stream contents in file
* Memory storage: collects input stream contents in RAM (very similar to datacollector)
* OpenIGTLinkServer: uses multiple streams as input; does not provide stream output, just sends the input data through OpenIGTLink
* Switcher: uses multiple streams as input (that may contain tracking and video data) and provides the latest received data on the output; mapping from transform names is defined for each input stream; useful for transferring multiple input streams on one output stream (e.g., when sending the latest US image through OpenIGTLink, regardless of the imaging depth)
* RF/B-mode converter

With regards to each device having its own thread, should this be the case even for virtual devices?

#### 2012-09-28, 22:55:09 - Andras Lasso
Yes, I think the simplest solution is to have a thread in each device (even in virtual devices).

#### 2012-10-01, 14:37:23 - Adam Rankin
Edit: config file removed, needs revisions.

#### 2012-10-01, 17:40:42 - Andras Lasso
The string-based links between devices, device hierarchies, and streams seems not just hard to read, and hard to write (the config file generator is not a simple solution), but also requires lots of additional error checking in the code. Also, the proposed config file structure does not correspond to the physical reality (a device 'owns' streams), which always complicates the implementation.

What is the advantage of the proposed config file structure?

#### 2012-10-02, 14:34:40 - Adam Rankin
A few questions regarding behaviour:

Say the US operator wants to change the depth setting. Would they change the depth setting on the US machine and our software would detect that change? Or would we ask them to change to their desired depth through fCal?

#### 2012-10-02, 15:05:07 - Tamas Ungi
In case of PlusServer, the only way is to turn the knob on the US machine. So PLUS would have to detect this anyway.

#### 2012-10-02, 15:09:09 - Andras Lasso
In some interfaces we can request the depth change (e.g., Ultrasonix), on other systems we can only get notification (e.g., BK), while on some others we need some special processing or manual interaction to find out that the depth has changed (e.g., framegrabber; in this case a potential solution is to do OCR to read the depth that is dispayed on the screen).

For calibration we don't really have to worry about dynamic change of the depth. We can expect the users to not change the depth _during_ calibration. However, the depth may be changed at any time during data acquisition or live streaming to Slicer.

#### 2012-10-02, 17:12:40 - Adam Rankin
I've come up with a new config layout. It allows the pipeline style approach I propose by defining a device as an aggregate of input streams and output streams.
In this manner, you can connect devices in any way you like, and it will simply operate on the data provided to it.
This config can be used for either 'smart' devices or devices that required the operator to signal a change.

The config file structure proposed in https://www.assembla.com/spaces/plus/tickets/461#comment:172646133 looks good. There is only one important note: the SonixVideo should have multiple output streams, e.g., one for each transducer and for each permitted depth. The pairing of images with transforms should be done separately for each output stream (there would be multiple 'VirtualTrackedFrameListProducer' device. Finally, to send all outputs through one single device there should be a stream switcher device that can redirect multiple inputs to one output stream by switching between them.

By the way, the VirtualTrackedFrameListProducer is actually a stream mixer device, so we should just use this standard name (rename 'VirtualTrackedFrameListProducer' to 'StreamMixerDevice' or something similar).

Clients of vtkDataCollector now request the latest tracked frame from the data collector. They can then request the vtkImageData from the underlying PlusVideoFrame.

This precludes the changes to merging vtkPlusVideoSource and vtkTracker. It will allow vtkPlusDevice to participate in the vtk pipeline using vtkPlusStream(s).

But you can link those to this one.

#### 2012-12-06, 23:58:34 - Andras Lasso
I think it's time to increase the major version number (Plus-2.1.0), as multi-stream is a major new functionality and we may want to break backward compatibility. If everything is backward compatible then the version change is not urgent but should be done sometime before the first stable release is published.

A release might be useful from the version that was created just before the multi-stream merge (Plus-1.7.x), as if there was any problem the user could easily try the pre-multi-stream version to see if the root cause of the issue should be searched for in multi-stream specific part of the code.


#### 2012-12-07, 17:04:29 - Adam Rankin
I agree with a 2.1 release.

It will no longer be backward compatible as the format of the configuration files is changing. I would recommend doing all the appropriate work to stabilize and release Plus-1.8 and then merge the multistream under Plus-2.1.

@rankin: I’ve started to review your multi-stream developments. You’ve done a great job in doing all the reorganization, redesign, and implementation work. I have a few questions, comments – see below. This was just a quick first round, let me when you finished the image buffer structure reorganization and then I do some more review.

---

1)  PlusConfiguration_VideoNone_3dConnexion.xml  => How the PlusOpenIGTLinkServer knows which OutputStream to observe?

2)  How fCal knows which OutputStream to observe?

3)  In the sample config files we should use standard device and stream names, corresponding only to the role of the device and stream. It would make them easier to understand and maintain.

Example:
    <Device Id='DeviceAscension3DG' … >
      <OutputStream Id='Output3DG' >   …   </OutputStream>
    </Device>
    <Device Id='DeviceSonixVideo' ... >
        <OutputStream Id='SonixOutput' … />
    </Device>
    <Device Id='FinalMixer' …>
      <OutputStream Id='Final'/>
    </Device>
=>
<Device Id='TrackerDevice' … >
      <OutputStream Id='TrackerStream' >   …   </OutputStream>
    </Device>
    <Device Id='VideoDevice' ... >
        <OutputStream Id='VideoStream' … />
    </Device>
    <Device Id='TrackedVideoMixerDevice' …>
      <OutputStream Id='TrackedVideoStream'/>
    
</Device>

Maybe we could find a better name for “TrackedVideoMixerDevice” and “TrackedVideoStream” (maybe TrackedUltrasoundMixerDevice, TrackerVideoMixerDevice, …).

4)  Can you define multiple OutputStream elements? Maybe it would be nicer to have a child element that would contain all the output stream elements, just to separate better from other child elements.

5)  How do you define if you want the video data in the output stream? I see how you can select transforms, but I don’t see how you can select if you want to output the video (and if the device can provide multiple video channels, which video channel).

6)  The output stream definition should be somewhat more generic, less hardware-independent. Instead of talking about connected “tools” and video we should talk about transforms and images (similarly to how PlusOpenIGTLinkServer inputs are defined).

Example:
    <Device …
        <Tool Name='Probe' PortName='0'></Tool>
        <Tool Name='Reference' PortName='1'></Tool>
        <Tool Name='Stylus' PortName='2'></Tool>
        <OutputStream … >
          <Tool Name='Probe'/>
          <Tool Name='Reference'/>
          <Tool Name='Stylus'/>
        </OutputStream>
      </Device>
=>
    <Device …
        <Tool Name='Probe' PortName='0'></Tool>
        <Tool Name='Reference' PortName='1'></Tool>
        <Tool Name='Stylus' PortName='2'></Tool>
        <OutputStream … >
          <Transform Name='Probe'/>
          <Transform Name='Reference'/>
          <Transform Name='Stylus'/>
          <Image Name=”CameraLeft”>
        </OutputStream>
      </Device>

7)  Would it make sense to implement the PlusOpenIGTLinkServer in Device? There would be some small advantages. I’m not sure if there were any disadvantages. Some advantages: It might be somewhat more consistent if all the outputs are implemented as virtual devices (e.g., save to disk, stream to OpenIGTLink); OpenIGTLink server functionality could be easily added to applications, such as fCal; it could be quite simple to define multiple PlusOpenIGTLinkServer instances with different streams (e.g., one stream with tracking only, another stream with tracked video).

8)  Don’t use smart pointers in method arguments, it just makes things harder to read and it may also result in extra copying

Example:
PlusStatus vtkPlusStream::GetBuffer( vtkSmartPointer<vtkPlusStreamBuffer>& aBuffer, int port )
=>
PlusStatus vtkPlusStream::GetBuffer(vtkPlusStreamBuffer*& aBuffer, int port )

9)  Getting a buffer item is a very expensive operation (it may allocate memory for an image frame and copy all the pixels and fields), so it should be only used when we actually need that data. For example, the usage in bool vtkPlusDevice::GetVideoDataAvailable() does not seem to be justified.


#### 2012-12-18, 20:50:45 - Adam Rankin
1) The OpenIGTLinkServer requests the tracked frame list from the data collector, which returns GetTrackedFrame from the currently selected device
2) fCal requests devices from the data collector. only devices that have Selectable='true' in their configuration will be visible. At the moment fCal does not allow individual stream selection.
3) The device and stream IDs can be anything. Did you mean for the config files in the repository?
4) You can define multiple OutputStream elements. The first working example of this will be the Sonix depth change adapting use case that I will create.
5) That is resolved with the work I am currently doing on the image buffers
6) It would be as easy as renaming the tag from 'Tool' to 'Transform'. Images will be addressed in my latest change
7) I think so! However it will probably be lower priority compared to the crash fixes and use cases in this ticket.
8) Won't this break the reference counting?
9) That function will also be addressed in the upcoming image buffer change

Should be uploaded.  Only tested under windows.  I know it won't build under linux/mac only because of me using windows.h and strncmp_s but those should be simple fixes.  There isn't much to it either.  the thing i found the most frustrating was the clipping until i figured out the rounding to multiples of 4.

I added the epiphan DLLs/libs and headers I had in the project although I am not sure that they are all required.

Got it. Thanks!!

#### 2012-05-23, 01:29:56 - cwedlake
No problem.  We are using it at a 1650x1050 (or clipped to 1648x1050 - or smaller) resolution only because that is what the IE 33 US machine is spitting out.  It should be able to handle higher resolutions and other frame rates but I have only tested it on a 1920x1200 output as well and that seemed fine.  Never tested to much clipping with other resolutions but it should still work the same.  I think the comments say a different resolution so just wanted to let you know.

#### 2012-05-23, 21:42:12 - Vikas Revanna Shivaprabhu
Andras,

I noticed that the VTK classes Chris has written uses base class vtkVideoSource and not vtkPlusVideoSource. I understand that earlier versions of PLUS used vtkVideoSource. Will I be able to link Epiphan to fcal without having to make changes to Chris' code ? In not, what is the best approach to make changes to the code so that it uses vtkPlusVideoSource. 

Thanks
Vikas



#### 2012-05-23, 22:40:30 - Andras Lasso
You have to use vtkPlusVideoSource as a base class, which is very different from the old vtkVideoSource class, so probably several changes are needed. I would suggest to clone and rename the ICCapturing class (it's a framegrabber class, should be quite similar to the Epiphan video source class) and override the following methods:
* InternalConnect
* InternalDisconnect
* InternalStartRecording
* InternalStopRecording
* AddFrameToBuffer
* ReadConfiguration
* WriteConfiguration

 You can also have a look at VideoForWindows, and SonixVideo classes as examples.


#### 2012-05-24, 15:42:50 - Andras Lasso
Vikas, it would be good to commit your code regularly so that we can follow the progress and give suggestions. It does not matter if it does not work or does not compile, as long as the code is not built by default.

I would propose the following steps:
* Create an EpiphanVideo directory in PlusLib\\src\\ImageAcquisition
* Copy the files that you received from Chris as is into the EpiphanVideo directory
* Copy the files from PlusLib\\src\\ImageAcquisition\\ICCapturing to the EpiphanVideo directory and rename them to vtkEpiphanVideoSource*
* Commit all the files
* Introduce a PLUS_USE_EPIPHAN_VIDEO build option (disabled by default) => I can do it for you, just let me know
* Add the required SDK files (only headers, static libs, dlls; skip samples and other non-essential files) to PlusLib\  ools\\Epiphan\\ so that the developers don't have download the SDK separately
* Update the vtkEpiphanVideoSource class with functions retrieved from Chris' implementation

Let me know if you need any help in completing the above steps.


#### 2012-05-24, 15:49:52 - cwedlake
is vtkPlusVideoSource build off of vtkVideoSource or vtkVideoSource2?  Everything I did with epiphan was done using vtkVideoSource as the base so if it inserts frames into the buffer differently then that will be something that needs to be changed as well.

#### 2012-05-24, 16:05:13 - Andras Lasso
The vtkPlusVideoSource does not have any resemblance to either vtkVideoSource or vtkVideoSource2. So I think the best approach is what I described above: implement the connect/disconnect/add frame/... methods using Chris' implementation as an example.


#### 2012-05-24, 16:27:53 - cwedlake
Whatever works for me, i was just warning that the inserting into the buffer could be different but if it doesn't match either then it is irrelevant.

#### 2012-05-24, 17:00:30 - Vikas Revanna Shivaprabhu
Andras,

I will check in the code with the changes/additions. Should I commit the changes to plus/trunk ? This is from where I checked out the code.

#### 2012-05-24, 17:54:51 - Vikas Revanna Shivaprabhu
Chris,

You are right. The way frames are inserted into to the buffer is different with vtkVideoSource and vtkPlusVideoSource. The entire inserting to the buffer part should be rewritten. And standard VCR methods can no longer be used. There is the InternalStartRecording and InternalStopRecording instead. 

#### 2012-05-24, 18:02:32 - Vikas Revanna Shivaprabhu
Chris,

I see that you have used a spawn thread to grab the frames, like so PlayerThreader->SpawnThread((vtkThreadFunctionType)\\  &vtkEpiphanVideoSourceRecordThread,this);
Can you tell me if creating a separate thread is part of vtkVideoSource's method to grab frames ? I don't see this methodology being used in the sample code that comes with Epiphan SDK.

Thanks
Vikas 

#### 2012-05-24, 19:44:44 - Andras Lasso
Should I commit the changes to plus/trunk? => yes

'standard VCR methods can no longer be used' => It's an advantage that you don't have to implement the VCR methods, just simple initialization and grabbing methods. We started with the VCR-like implementation but it turned out that it is a really bad model of what's happening: the VCR model is more complex and at the same time more limiting than necessary.

If the framegrabber driver calls a callback function whenever a new frame is available then you don't need to start your own thread. A typical example is the vtkICCapturingSource.

If the driver just gives you API for requesting frames one-by-one then you can use the SpawnThreadForRecording functionality in the vtkPlusVideoSource base class. It starts a thread that calls the InternalGrab function at regular intervals. This method is used by the vtkOpenIGTLinkVideoSource and vtkSavedDataVideoSource classes.


#### 2012-05-24, 20:25:39 - Vikas Revanna Shivaprabhu
Thank you for the suggestions.  You saved me some hardship. I was just looking at how to proceed without the callback function. Epiphan API provides functionality to request frames one-by-one and does not have a callback function that can be registered when a new frame arrives.

I will take a look at SpawnThreadForRecording.

Major changes done to vtkEpiphanVideoSource
Device now connects successfully in fcal. 

#### 2012-05-25, 13:48:59 - Andras Lasso
Very good! A few suggestions for the code:
*   You've implemented the timestamping correctly (you don't specify a timestamp for this->Buffer->AddItem, so the current time is used). The vtkAccurateTimer has a 1ms resolution, and much more reliable and accurate than vtkTimerLog::GetUniversalTime,  GetSystemTime, etc., so you can remove the other time functions.
* Need to delete this->cropRect in the destructor
* Read serialNumber from the config file (just add a few lines for read/write in the ReadConfiguration/WriteConfiguration functions)
* Change char serialNumber[15] to char *serialNumber, initialize it to 0 in the constructor, use VTK set macros to set its value, and delete in the destructor (you can set it to NULL with the VTK set macro)
* In InternalStartRecording and InternalStopRecording you should call FrmGrab_Start and FrmGrab_Stop (according to Epiphan documentation it is not essential for local framegrabbers, but critical for network grabbers)
* In vtkEpiphanVideoSource::InternalGrab   if (frame == NULL)  { return PLUS_SUCCESS;  } is strange. It looks to be an error case, so you should log an error or a warning and consider with returning PLUS_FAIL

* Removed timing vtkTimerLog function. Time stamp now done internally by PLUS
* Added delete this->cropRect in destructor
* Added FrmGrab_Start and FrmGrab_Stop in InternalStartRecording and InternalStopRecording
* Added error message if frame==NULL and changed return value to PLUS_FAIL
* The following specification can read from configuration file:
   SerialNumber
   VideoFormat - Support for RGB8 and Y8 (default Y8)
   CropRectX, CropRectY,CropRectWidth,CropRectHeight (default NULL)
* Cleaned the code
* Ready to be tested by others

## #466 Implement OCR functionality to read ultrasound imaging parameters from grabbed screens
Preliminary implementation is already available. Need to be integrated into Plus.

Integration steps:
* Develop a configuration GUI widget to set up and test the OCR parameters (position of text fields, US image, etc.). There is a similar widget in Plus for setting the image position and some segmentation parameters – this new widget could work similarly (see https://www.assembla.com/code/plus/subversion/nodes/trunk/PlusApp/CommonWidgets/SegmentationParameterDialog.*)
* Integrate the algorithm  into Plus (algorithm code, configuration GUI, simple test app, test data sets, automatic non-regressions tests)

Commit: r:4477|plus:4477

#### 2016-01-28, 16:21:55 - Andras Lasso
I guess the class will not be specific to screen reading. So, I would suggest renaming it to vtkVirtualTextReader, vtkVirtualTextRecognizer or something similar. No need to rename it now, as during implementation the actual content and scope of the class may change.

It would be nice to be able to define rectangles where you read numbers, associate each of them with a name, and then use vtkFunctionParser to compute transformation matrix from a user-defined formula. You can use 'if' in vtkFunctionParse, so you can construct any formula. Most of the times a simple linear formula such as scaling = windowHeight/depth would not work, as the ultrasound software can arbitrarily change the transducer origin position in the image on and window size as the image depth is changed.

#### 2016-01-28, 16:23:19 - Adam Rankin
Agreed.

Agreed very much. I haven't even scoped the functionality of the device, I am just testing the tesseract engine. When I've determined that it actually works (or not) we can move forward with a feature discussion!

## #468 DataCollector file mode, look for data file next to config file.
It would be convenient to set up testing folders if the function that reads the DataCollector config file in File mode would look for the data file (SequenceMetafile) in the same folder where the config file is. So in a test data folder there would be a config file and a data file. The config file would just say ... SequenceMetafile='Test.mha' ... and the fCal applications would find Test.mha regardless of the absolute path.

#### 2012-04-02, 20:30:50 - Csaba Pinter
You can use relative path too.
If you enter a relative path, it will be relative to the directory that is given in PlusConfig.xml (which is in the same directory as your executable) in the attribute ImageDirectory.
If you set the ImageDirectory the same as DeviceSetConfigurationDirectory, then you get the behavior you described above.

#### 2012-04-03, 15:43:49 - Csaba Pinter
According to a discussion with Andras, Plus will look for relative path from two locations. Beside checking it from the ImageDirectory path defined in PlusConfig, it will also check relative from the loaded device set configuration file.

We are on the issue, but without log files (in debug but rather trace level) it is difficult.

Siavash: I would appreciate your contribution in the form of a trace level log file and the corresponding configuration file, our job would be much easier that way. Thanks!

So far, I have been unable to reproduce a crash. I've been testing on an NDI Certus tracker running fCal revision 1892.

I was able to reproduce the error log where the Certus tracker no longer communicates with the host machine, but I am unable to determine why. The NDI API simply states that there is a communications error between the host and the tracker.



#### 2012-07-11, 15:53:52 - Andras Lasso
OK, I think we can close this issue.

How often do you have the communication error? After how long acquisition time?

#### 2012-07-11, 16:57:56 - Adam Rankin
I can't seem to reproduce the communication error. I went to check on the machine and it had had its lenses covered. Perhaps this was the cause? I've reset the tracker and have had no issues after running it for an hour.

#### 2012-07-11, 17:08:38 - Adam Rankin
Correction: It happened again. I disconnected after 58 minutes. Did some work, reconnected to try again, and it happened after a few minutes (5-8).

After inspecting the machine, nothing has changed with the physical configuration of the tracker.

#### 2012-07-11, 17:42:14 - Andras Lasso
Have you restarted fCal when you reconnected? Or just disconnected and connected while keeping fCal running?

#### 2012-07-11, 17:46:39 - Adam Rankin
Restarted fCal. I do not believe the problem is Plus. I will continue investigating.

#### 2012-07-11, 17:51:26 - Andras Lasso
If you cannot make any conclusion then just close this ticket, enter a new ticket with the title 'Communication with NDI Certus tracker randomly breaks', and put it into the Future milestone (very few people use the Certus, so it's not a very high priority for now).

Allow tracked US acquisition using a real tracker and a simulated US device. The simulated US and tracking info could be broadcasted to Slicer through OpenIGTLink using OpenIGTLinkBroadcaster, the same way as for any other imaging device.

Design:
* A transform would be defined in the config file for each model
* The US simulator image source would access the transform repository and generate the simulated image using the transform and the model
* How to get the tracker info? RAW tracker buffer? => Need a design, related to #461

h1. Prerequisites: 
* Qt 4.7.4-x64:
Qt doesn't provide pre-built VS2010 x64 binaries with the latest release, so we need to compile it:
- Download and extract Qt 4.7.4 source to c:\\Qt\\4.7.4-x64\\  (http://download.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.7.4.zip)
- Start Visual Studio x64 Win64 Command Prompt (2010)  ( Start / All Programs / Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 / Visual Studio Tools )
- Type the following commands to the console: 


~~~~

$ cd c:\\Qt\\4.7.4-x64\\
$ configure -shared -debug-and-release -opensource -opengl desktop -platform win32-msvc2010 -mp -nomake examples -nomake demos

#### 2012-04-20, 15:27:55 - Andras Lasso
If there is no specific reason for using Qt-4.8.1 I would prefer to use Slicer4's version (4.7.4 ). It would allow us to build Slicer extensions with Plus. Note that 64-bit build of Qt-4.7.4 does not require perl installation (I hope that Qt-4.8.1 does not really require it either). Build instructions (for VS2008 / Qt-4.7.4) are available here: http://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Documentation/4.0/Developers/Build_Instructions/Prerequisites/Qt#Windows_4.

#### 2012-04-20, 15:57:08 - Tamas Heffter

## #479 Add version information to Plus binaries  
This is a proposal for adding version information to Plus binaries, which could be really helpful identifying the actual dll and app version.

## #480 Using Hole Filling with Maximum Distribution produces different results for 32-bit vs. 64-bit
If hole filling is enabled in the test _vtkVolumeReconstructorMaximum1_, different results will be produced between a 32-bit build and a 64-bit build. Hole filling can be enabled by opening the configuration file _SpinePhantomFreehandReconstructionOnlyMaximum.xml_ and changing HoleFilling='Off' to HoleFilling='On'.

Once this is fixed, the test should use hole filling by default, and the output volume should be saved as _vtkVolumeReconstructorMaximum1OutputCompare.vtk_ for use by the test _vtkVolumeReconstructorMaximum2_

#### 2012-04-25, 18:48:46 - Thomas Vaughan
It might actually make sense to leave this one until we've implemented the sticks hole filling, as per #436. If sticks hole filling produces a better result and does not have this problem, then it might not make a lot of sense to invest time in this.

## #486 VolumeReconstructor should take a 'skip number' and 'hole filling method' as input
When we test our hole filling in volume reconstruction, we usually create two volumes: a ground truth and a testing volume. The ground truth usually consists of a very dense set of US images. The testing volume consists of a subset of these images (usually every 4th image of the original dataset), with holes filled in.

We need a way to specify how many images we skip over when creating the testing volume *without* changing the volume reconstruction source code.

We also need a way to specify whether to use a kernel or sticks method for hole filling.

## #487 Allow temporal calibration to be performed using a calibration phantom
The new correlation-based temporal calibration works well for free-hand US, but when the transducer is in a stabilizer then it is more convenient to do the temporal calibration with the same phantom used for spatial calibration.

Modify the temporal calibration algorithm so that it can use an externally-computed video-based position signal. Modify the iCal application to use the new temporal calibration method.

Change iCalBrachy so that it uses this temporal calibration instead of vtkDataCollectorSynchronizer. Delete vtkDataCollectorSynchronizer class from the repository.

Performing the temporal and spatial calibration with the same phantom is useful in general.

The implementation could be just adding a new FRAME_TYPE, e.g., FRAME_TYPE_VIDEO_NWIRE_PHANTOM (and maybe change FRAME_TYPE_VIDEO_PLANE_PHANTOM) and use the FidSegmentation instead of the vtkLineSegmentationAlgo.

## #488 Add a feature to fCal where the user can change the displayed image orientation
It would help visualization during fCal data acquisition if a feature was added where the user could change the camera position (aka image orientation). The sonographer we work with did not like that the image that appeared in fCal was flipped compared to the exam software.

In the US devices you can flip the image for display. In fCal currently the image is always displayed with a fixed orientation, which sometimes does not match what the clinicians would like to see. Introduce options for flipping the image horizontally and/or vertically in the 2D view. It is only for the 2D view, the 3D view is good as is.

#### 2012-05-05, 01:25:00 - Andras Lasso
Build errors have been resolved, but tests fail due to DLL conflicts.

Remaining problems:
* The ulterius DLL depends on QT DLLs, which are conflicting with the DLLs used by Plus. This should be fixed in the Ulterius SDK by static linking of the libraries, by using manifests, or name mangling.
* The porta DLL depends on ITK, VTK, and QT DLLs, which are conflicting with the DLLs used by Plus. This should be fixed in the Ulterius SDK by static linking of the libraries, by using manifests, or name mangling.
* The porta object does not contain the bool getLastError(char* err, unsigned int sz) method anymore. Is there a replacement?
* The ulterius\\inc\\ImagingModes.h file does not contain RfMode anymore. Does it mean that RF acquisition is not possible through Ulterius?
* The porta_wrapper.cpp file should contain all the necessary header includes 

Enhancement possibilities:
* It would be nice if the SDK would generate a UseUltrasonix.cmake file

It seems that we have to wait for a while until Ultrasonix can clean up these dependencies. See the reply from Ultrasonix:


Re: ITK, VTK, QT DLL conflicts with SDK 6.0.1
by stephane.raux » Mon May 07, 2012 11:35 pm

Hi Andras,


Theoretically our SDK should not depend on ITK and VTK. We just have too many dependencies between our modules and one of them ends up pulling a third-party DLL which we don't have control over and this DLL relies on some version of ITK and VTK.

Cleaning up our dependencies is something we plan to do. Unfortunately it is a huge task which requires time. 6.0.x is our first release depending on Qt and for now the only supported option for our SDK users wanting to use Qt is to use the same version as we do. We will try to stay up-to-date with the latest Qt version. What concerns ITK and VTK, we don't have control over what version is used or the build process itself.

Once we are done cleaning our module dependencies, ITK and VTK should not be needed anymore by our SDK. At that time we will see what to do with the Qt DLLs (we will probably make use of the '-qtlibinfix' option).

We are in the process of re-engineering our SDK to ease the task of our users (e.g. the switch to a C interface to allow the use of other compilers as well as making it easier to create wrappers for other languages), enrich the set of features, improve robustness and modernize our tools. This is a long process and we need time to achieve these goals.


Once again we are sorry for the inconvenience.

We are waiting for Ultrasonix to release a new SDK version without the dependencies. Until then the Ultrasonix SDK 6.x will not be officially supported.

Possible workarounds for 6.0.1:
* Use the same QT version as the one used by Ultrasonix
* Don't use Porta (it depends an own ITK and VTK version)

In Ultrasonix SDK 6.0.7 there are no ITK and VTK dlls anymore. The only remaining issue is Qt. The solution would be to build Qt with custom library names and using a custom namespace (http://qt-project.org/forums/viewthread/9577) when Ultrasonix builds the SDK files.

## #492 Plus Server crashes without --verbose=5 in Release mode
I can use PlusServer in Debug mode. Also in Release mode if I provide the command line argument --verbose=5. But when I don't set the --verbose option in Release mode, the PlusServer crashes after one or two messages. Here is video to illustrate the problem:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkHEB3s4mTw
The same error happens with a real tracker (Ascension).

My config file is also available from here:
https://www.assembla.com/code/slicerigt/subversion/nodes/trunk/PlusTestData/StillThanMove40mmNoVideo.xml?rev=62
It uses the saved tracked data from the same folder:
https://www.assembla.com/code/slicerigt/subversion/nodes/trunk/PlusTestData

This problem doesn't happen when the images are sent with the server. I only discovered it when I removed the image message from the PlusOpenIGTLinkServer configuration. I cannot send image messages in my current hardware setup, because in one of the needle navigation scenarios there is no ultrasound involved.

## #493 PlusServer not working with real tracker
I tried PlusServer with the Ascension tracker. Two tools (Stylus, Reference), no video. I attach the config file, it worked perfectly with vtkDataCollectorTrackingTest.
The tracker frequency is 100 /s because there is a lag in tracking with vtkDataCollectorTrackingTest at lower frequency values.
At lower frequencies in the config file, there are some messages going out from PlusServer, but when I visualize them in Slicer, they look like flickering rather than tracking, and occasionally the messages stop being sent and the typical problem occurs (warnings, no messages sent).

This is the typical output of PlusServer when failing to send tracking messages (this is repeated continuously):
|WARNING|025.775000| Failed to get tracker buffer item: tracker item not available anymore|in ..\\..\\..\\PlusLib\\src\  racking\\vtkTrackerBuffer.cxx(281)
|DEBUG|025.783000| Number of added frames: 0 out of 0|in ..\\..\\..\\PlusLib\\src\\DataCollection\\vtkDataCollectorHardwareDevice.cxx(795)

I attach a log file with trace level logging. It actually contains three phases. In the first time phase there were errors and no tracking messages. Then in the middle the transforms were sent and received well on the other end. Then the typical problem started with warnings and no messages sent. The typical problem is the third phase with the warning.

Basic support has been added.

Limitations: no complex processing or sensor fusion is performed, i.e.,
* the accelerometer is just used as a tilt sensor
* the gyroscope data is not really usable as is, but further processing would be needed
* absolute position and angle is not computed

## #498 PlusServer should not forward invalid transforms
If there is an invalid tracker transform then the PlusServer just sends it through OpenIGTLink. It results in flickering in Slicer (whenever there is an invalid transform then the attached model jumps back to a default pose). There should be an option to either
* not send invalid transforms, or
* send the transform without any changes (then the tracker could just send the last known transform and set the status to invalid; this would cause the models to not move if there is any error instead of jumping)

Also, writing a warning on the console each time there is an invalid transform may not be desirable (it may be normal that the tracker gets out of view). Maybe make it an option to show a warning for invalid transforms.

## #499 Make tool status display window easier to access in fCal
Now the tool status display widget sits in Configuration toolbox. Although there is a pop-out button near it, it is not as obvious as this feature is needed.
A more visible message is needed near the widget, and the pop-out button should be moved to the common toolbar (where the configuration saving and the options buttons are), and changed it to 'Tracker tool status' button with a suitable icon.

#### 2012-05-16, 15:40:56 - Csaba Pinter
You can detach the tool status display window in Configuration toolbox by clicking the button near it, and so keep it visible when using any other toolbox.
Please don't assign to a milestone right away, it can slip out of our attention this way. Thanks!

## #500 Volume Reconstructor, Hole Filling: Change Gaussian Weight representation from unsigned long to double

(In r:1707) Re #500, Re #508, Gaussian kernel is now calculated as floating point numbers. There was a bug in the calculation of the Gaussian matrix causing significant bias in weighing toward the x axis, but this has been fixed.

There are also two new hole filling methods, NEAREST_NEIGHBOR and DISTANCE_WEIGHT_INVERSE. These will be compared against the STICKS algorithm.

@rankin: Is it possible to choose between a color/grayscale output for the MMF video source? (if I acquire US images then I need grayscale, if I acquire endoscopy images then I need RGB)

#### 2014-03-06, 01:56:22 - Adam Rankin
Do you mean live?

Not at the moment.

I could easily add a feature that populated multiple video sources with the same image, converted to different image types.

Then all you would have to do is have two video sources: one set to image type=rgb_color and one image type=us_brightness (I'll have to check exact syntax).

Then you can have two output channels, one for each video source. 

#### 2014-03-06, 02:17:39 - Andras Lasso
No, I mean just static definition.

Is there a sample config file for MMF with color? I've just added ImageType='RGB_COLOR' to the video source and broadcast it to Slicer but in Slicer the volume appears scrambled and in the volume module it appears as single-channel.

#### 2014-03-06, 02:24:25 - Adam Rankin
Hmmm... I will investigate slicer. Is that igtl image message or igtl tracked frame message?

#### 2014-03-06, 02:26:09 - Andras Lasso
Normal image message. If I remove the ImageType then it sends grayscale images that appear correctly.

#### 2014-03-06, 02:30:11 - Adam Rankin
Ok I'll check it out

#### 2014-03-06, 02:31:23 - Andras Lasso
With the same config file, with the ImageType='RGB_COLOR' the image is nice and colorful in fCal!

#### 2014-03-06, 02:32:30 - Adam Rankin
Yeah plus uses the tracked frame message. I've screwed something up for image messages.

#### 2014-03-06, 02:35:55 - Andras Lasso
Saving to metafile from fCal and loading to Slicer from fCal works well, too! So, it seems that only the image messages don't work perfectly yet for color images - but I'm sure you'll be able to fix this very quickly. It's so impressive to see color images everywhere :)

Tried to broadcast a color image from webcam with MMF and with the latest Slicer trunk version and I get this error in the Slicer log (and no image appears):

Warning: In ..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\OpenIGTLinkIF\\MRML\\vtkIGTLToMRMLImage.cxx, line 76
vtkIGTLToMRMLImage (0000000015258390): Unable to cast incoming message to image message. Defaulting display node to greyscale.

Does it work for you?


#### 2014-04-23, 04:58:54 - Andras Lasso
I've fixed the implementation:
* color images are displayed as true color (not with rainbow LUT; the node type had to be set to vtkMRMLVectorVolumeNode)
* no more crash or partial image update if number of components are changed (if there is a mismatch then the image is not updated and an error is logged).

@rankin: Could you please review and test the changes and submit a pull request if everything is OK? Thanks!

#### 2014-04-23, 17:25:48 - Adam Rankin
Working great under windows, testing under Linux shortly.

Works well with latest trunk version of Plus and nightly Slicer release.

## #503 Implement sensor fusion algorithm for getting full 6-DOF pose from MARG sensors
Data acquisition is supported with the Phidget Spatial magnetic, angular rate, and gravity (MARG) sensor. However, the raw measurement data does not provide full 6-DOF position and orientation information.

Need to integrate a sensor fusion algorithm that can compute the pose from the raw measurement values, such as:

## #506 Advise the user during free-hand calibration about what motions patterns should be performed
For a good calibration it is important to translate and rotate the transducer in a sufficiently large range along various axes. The software could determine if translation and rotation motion was large enough along all axes and could display messages that would instruct the user to make certain motions to ensure optimal coverage.

## #507 Axes of the ImageToProbeTransform are not always orthogonal
The probe calibration algorithm determines the ImageToProbeTransform axes independently, therefore if there is an error in the calibration procedure then the computed coordinate axes may not be orthogonal.

Root cause: most frequently the root cause of the problem is that the phantom description does not match the actual phantom geometry (the wire positions in the phantom are not the same as the actual wire positions) or it may be caused by having a large number of fiducial line intersection point detection errors (the calibration algorithm can remove a limited number of outliers if they are very different from the true positions and the outliers are less than about 5-10% of the data).

The calibration algorithm should be changed so that it always returns the best possible *orthogonal* transform.

The algorithms described in this paper may work: http://iopscience.iop.org/0031-9155/46/2/321/pdf/m10221.pdf

One easy fix is:

[U,S,V] = svd(m(1:3,1:3));
R = U*V';

Now the R is the proper orthonormal matrix. In fact, the S is the scaling matrix (which is different from what PLUS calculates). If one wishes to put the anisotropic scaling back to R, I would do:

sx,sy,sz; // anisotropic scaling from, say, PLUS calibration
R(1:3,1) = R(1:3,1)*sx;
R(1:3,2) = R(1:3,2)*sy;
R(1:3,3) = R(1:3,3)*sz;

then:

m(1:3,1:3) = R;

Use an algorithm similar to vtkPivotCalibrationAlgo to optimize 3 translation + 3 rotation + 1 or 2 scaling (1 for curvilinear transducer, 2 for linear transducer).
Use the current LS algorithm result as initial values. Limit the search range to a couple of mm and deg.

Guillermo: work with Csaba until I get back (on Oct 10, 2012).

class vtkSpatialCalibrationOptimizer was modified. A first solution of the optimization problem was implemented using vtk amoeba minimizer to estimate 8 parametes (3 rotation, 3 translation + 2 scales)
Some code was added to vtkProbeCalibrationAlgo for interfacing with vtkSpatialCalibrationOptimizer. This code is currently commented.

#### 2012-09-28, 22:53:40 - Csaba Pinter
Guillermo,

Please try to stick to the coding convention and be more exact, because your code was quite inconsistent in terms of formatting and variable and function naming, which makes it very hard to read and also hurts the eyes.

I cleaned it up now, but I don't plan to do it after each commit of yours.
Please also comb through the code for things to fix, there are still lots of them (for example a variable named 'A' is not something that makes the code more readable).

Thanks!

#### 2012-09-29, 08:34:43 - Andras Lasso
Guillermo, it was very quick. I'm looking forward to seeing the results. You can test the algorithm by doing calibration using a phantom description that is slightly different from the actual wire positions of the phantom and/or use only 2 wires for the calibration that are close to each other. This way the LS optimization will result a skewed image, which should be straightened by the new algorithm.

* Some variables and functions were renamed in order to satisfy the required format.
* In vtkProbeCalibrationAlgo.cxx was added the method SetAndValidateImageToProbeTransform2. Basically it does the same than SetAndValidateImageToProbeTransform but doesn't correct the third row of the transformation to make it orthogonal to the first and second.

(In r:2493|plus:2493) re #507: Simplified implementation of the non-linear calibration optimization step. The optimizer is switched to Amoeba method, as it doesn't require gradients and it optimizes a single-valued cost function. The optimization can be enabled by adding the following attributes to the vtkProbeCalibrationAlgo XML element: OptimizationMethod='2D' (or 3D) and IsotropicPixelSpacing='TRUE' (or FALSE). OptimizationMethod='2D' is recommended. For linear transducers IsotropicPixelSpacing='FALSE' is recommended to allow identification of X and Y pixel spacing separately (caused by speed-of-sound mismatch). For curvilinear transducers IsotropicPixelSpacing='TRUE' is recommended, because after curvilinear scan conversion speed-of-sound mismatch cannot be compensated.

Some non-regression tests fail on linux. The root cause is that there are some differences in the fiducial segmentation on linux, which leads to differences in the calibration results as well. Need to replace the calibration/validation data set anyway, because they don't correspond to the same phantom. Hopefully the differences will be negligible with the new data sets.

Orthogonality of the ImageToProbe transformation matrix can be enforced by adding the OptimizationMethod attribute (with value '2D' or '3D') to the vtkProbeCalibrationAlgo element in the device set config file. Isotropic image pixel spacing can be enforced by adding IsotropicPixelSpacing='TRUE' to vtkProbeCalibrationAlgo element.

Thanks for the fixes. Probably due to the slightly different output of the algorithms 3 volume reconstruction related tests fail (http://crunch.cs.queensu.ca/CDash/viewTest.php?onlyfailed&buildid=7578). Please review the results and update the baseline data as needed.

## #510 Polaris Spectra wired tools are not detected
Polaris Spectra passive (wireless) tools work well, but active (wired) tools are not detected.

The NDI combined API sample program works well with both active and passive tools and it also seems simpler than the code that is used by Plus now. So probably it would be better to rewrite the NDI tracker class based on this sample (attached).

fixed #510: Polaris wired and wireless tools are now correctly detected. Wired tools are defined by the PortName attribute (first is '0'), wireless tools are defined by the RomName attribute (specifies the ROM file name).

* PortName attribute should not be specified for wireless tools (if it is defined then it is ignored).
* PortName is not required anymore for OpenIGTLinkTracker and SavedDataSet.
* RequireToolAveragedItemsForFilteringInDeviceSetConfiguration is removed, the AveragedItemsForFiltering attribute is always optional
* ToolName is rename consistently to data source ID
* Fixed NDI Certus build error if Polaris build was disabled
* Renamed GetFirstActiveTool to GetTimestampMaster tool and it now returns the tool that was added first to the channel. It is more predictable than picking the first tool in the map (that depends on the tool name and the hash function). If needed, in the future the master tool might be made selectable by the user.

## #511 fCal should not use the Date attribute for determining if the system is calibrated or not
Currently fCal adds a Date attribute to the calibration transforms to indicate that they are result of a valid calibration. This is not intuitive and may lead to misunderstandings (people may add a Matrix but fCal does not use it because the Date is missing)

e.g.,
    <Transform From='Phantom' To='Reference'
      Matrix='0.9968 0.0075 -0.0795 -35.6089
              0.0794 0.0055 0.9968 -124.9852
              0.0079 -1.0000 0.0049 -16.7
              0 0 0 1'
      Date='2011.12.01 17:57:00' Error='0.0'
    />

Recommended solution: Add attributes in the fCal element to remember which calibrations have been performed already.

I think when I reported the bug, I was looking at the Calibration tab before the device had successfully connected. Hence the temporal calibration was inactive. If the device is connected, temporal calibration is active even without any transforms in the config file, which is how it is supposed to be.

## #514 Command-line argument names are long and not consistent
There is no consistent naming convention for the command-line arguments of the test applications.

Potential rules could be:

* postfix file name arguments with '-file'; for sequence of tracked frames: '-seq-file', for volumetric images: '-volume-file'
* postfix directory path arguments with '-dir'
* postfix transform names with '-transform'
* always use the '--config-file' argument if there is only one single XML input config file
* always use the '--seq-file' argument if there is only one single input sequence metafile

The stylus calibration still failes sometimes (http://crunch.cs.queensu.ca/CDash/viewTest.php?onlydelta&buildid=7261), because only the X axis is computed deterministically.

Need to change the implementation to define the Y and Z axis deterministically (e.g., closest to the Y and Z unit vectors).

## #518 Design new fCal phantom for simpler thread configuration
New features of the new version of fCal phantom:
- Use 5 mm grid for all positioning for intuitive location coordinates (grid holes most importantly).
- Use tilted grid holes to force thread on one side consistently.
- Larger thread fixation posts.
- More thread fixation posts (4 instead of 2).
- One more layer for threads. 5 layer altogether will allow 3 N-layers 10 mm apart each.
- Put a Marked (M) sign on the left side if we look at it from the Front.
- Make interface for handle to avoid hands getting wet.
- Enlarge the phantom in all directions for more freedom of motion.
- Tilted side walls to avoid long echoes.

Can we elongenate the walls upwards to make imaging of the wires easier? Or something to address this, while allowing enough movements in the same time.
Maybe this way the person who calibrates could hold the phantom more easily. The procedure makes you quite wet now.
Just a discussion starter...

#### 2012-06-06, 17:54:13 - Csaba Pinter
One important thing: we need to mark the marked side in the design (what we have done with the marker pen so far). The marked side is the left side if we look at the front.

#### 2012-06-06, 18:02:09 - Siavash Khallaghi
1. I don't know if what I am going to suggest is feasible, but right now it is not easy to image the phantom with curved probes and not get the walls. Is it possible to make the two sides, i.e the ones with the landmarks, into a V-shape so that there is less reflection from the phantom wall?

2. Is it possible to increase the wire length, i.e. increase the distance between *e* and *E* side? This will allow more rotational freedom without getting the walls when calibrating curved probes.

It would be also useful to increase the height of the phantom. It would allow larger distance between the N-wire planes and could result in smaller plane tilt errors.

It would be good if there was a little push hole for the square hole where the model 800 ascension tracker sensor fits. This would make it easier to push the sensor out of the phantom - we had a hard time removing it.

#### 2012-06-07, 11:26:03 - Tamas Ungi
Yes, this is already there in the latest design. I'm sorry you don't have that. If you have an older version, drill a hole in the bottom of the model 800 holder to be safe for the future.

## #519 Memory leak during data collection
vtkTimestampedCircularBuffer<BufferItemType>::CreateFilteredTimeStampForItem leaks memory, because it stores all filtered timestamps in this->TimeStampReportTable. By default recording of these values should be disabled. It should be enabled only temporarily, for diagnostic purposes.

The leak can cause crash on 32-bit systems if fCal runs continuously for about 10 hours.

## #520 Replace eye icon in fCal with a 3d objects icon
The function of the 'eye' icon in fCal is: show all objects in 3D.

Filters can be defined for individual tools in the Ascension demo software. It this is possible through the API, it would be better to leave this option in PLUS too. Not urgent, but we may want to put these parameters to the Tool elements instead of the Tracker.

This happened to me when there were too many candidate points (ie too much white in the US image). Either reduce the gain before going into the seg parameters or change the size of the ROI in the config file in the fCal tag.

Mattea, is it this crash (the process exits) or hang (the application does not respond, or very slow to respond)?
Could you take a screenshot of the application when it happens? (just to confirm that it's due to the many detected candidate points)

#### 2012-06-24, 14:53:10 - Andras Lasso
It is not a crash, but a freeze for up to a few ten seconds or more. The root cause is that the fiducial segmentation algorithm computation time grows exponentially with the number of fiducial point candidates. This makes the segmentation parameter tuning very annoying (need to kill & restart fCal many times).

Proposed solution: Set a maximum threshold for the number of fiducial point candidates. If more point candidates are found then stop the processing and return with an error. The user shall be notified that too many candidate points have been found and that caused the error (it would be difficult for the user to figure out what caused the problem otherwise). Don't do any further processing, don't try to detect the lines, etc. if there are too many candidate points, because the actual fiducial points might have been missed and there is a high chance for mislabeling.
 
Implementation: add new segmentation parameter in the config file, set the threshold in the algorithm (FidSegmentation::m_NumDots should be below the threshold), if too many points then return with an error from the algo, stop further processing, and display a message in the segmentation dialog.

There are a couple of problems in fCal in data collector management:
* The video source is not deleted when the data collector is deleted (Connect, Disconnect, Connect -> at this point the old data collector is deleted, but the video source is not)
* The data collector is not deleted at disconnect. Data collector is just deleted when connecting again. It is because vtkVisualizationController does not set the data collector in ImageVisualizer and PerspectiveVisualizer at disconnect, only at connect.

In general: Initialize...() methods should be called in the constructor only.
InitializeDataCollector(DataCollector *dc) methods should be called SetDataCollector(...) and behave accordingly (when dc is NULL they shall release the data collector).

## #524 Workflow of Temporal and Spatial Calibration
Would make more sense to have the Temporal Calibration above the Spacial Calibration in the fCal GUI to prevent people from forgetting to do Temporal Calibration first

#### 2012-06-08, 19:11:45 - Andras Lasso
Or at least move the temporal calibration controls above the spatial calibration controls to indicate that temporal calibration should be done first.
If temporal calibration has not been performed then fCal could display a warning.

#### 2012-06-08, 19:20:08 - Adam Rankin
If the workflow says temporal calibration must be done first, would it be wise/worth it to disable spatial calibration until temporal is done?

#### 2012-06-08, 19:22:36 - Mattea Welch
summary: changed from "Workflow of Temporal and Spacial Calibration" to "Workflow of Temporal and Spatial Calibration"

#### 2012-06-08, 19:24:30 - Tamas Ungi
In some (most of the) cases the correct temporal calibration is saved in the config file. For e.g. if you are using fCal repeatedly. So in some cases it's OK to not run temporal calibration before spatial. Having the GUI for temporal above the spatial, and maybe a note (not warning) that the loaded time offset is used should be enough to remind users.

#### 2012-06-08, 19:31:49 - Andras Lasso
If temporal calibration has not been performed then a text in orange (not a warning:)) could appear near the spatial calibration button that temporal calibration has not yet been performed.

We could store in the DeviceSet configuration file in the fCal element if (and when) the temporal calibration has been performed.


#### 2012-06-08, 20:42:20 - Csaba Pinter
I agree. (change order and display warning)

For the person who works on this: there is an orange color used in the FreehandCalibrationToolbox already (if the calibration error is between 1 and 2 mm), that color should be used here too for consistency

#### 2012-06-28, 21:19:34 - Andras Lasso

## #525 Organize configuration files in the repository
The number of configuration files became very big and the data/ConfigFiles directory is now a mess. We need to organize it better and find a good way to maintain them.

Suggested solution:
1. Create subdirectories for the institutions that use (added) a configuration file in data/ConfigFiles
2. Only the sample and simulated configuration files remain in the data/ConfigFiles directory. These are the ones that go in the installation package
3. When the configuration file structure changes in any way,
  3.1. Increment the configuration file version number in WriteConfiguration
  3.2. Increment the configuration file version numbers in the existing configuration files to maintain
  3.3. Refresh the wiki page about the configuration file structure if needed
  3.4. Add an entry in the configuration file structure history wiki page (to be created) with the changes just introduced
4. Change the code so that the programs warn the user if the version of the loaded configuration file (3.2) is older than the latest one (the number we updated in 3.1)

PlusServer command line app will stay in PlusLib and a GUI application will be in PlusApp. If it's not convenient for anybody, please let me know. 

#### 2012-06-14, 23:58:55 - Andras Lasso
I agree that it's not nice to have an application in the Testing directory. Is there any other reason for moving the PlusServer to PlusApp?
Maybe we could have Applications directories in addition to Testing directories and we would move those executables that are useful not just for testing?


#### 2012-06-15, 00:06:25 - Csaba Pinter
Tomi, if you really don't want to move it in PlusApp, then I suggest doing what Andras said: create an Applications directory.

It's very strange that we have a whole wiki page for it that starts like 'PlusServer is an application...', still one can hardly find it because it's hiding in an inner directory named Testing.

#### 2012-06-15, 01:09:16 - Tamas Heffter
Ok, applications dir sound's good to me. An shouldn't we do the same thing with the other applications that we pack with the lib? 
I would keep it in the Lib because it's just a test application (and an example how to use it), without any user friendly feature (and also it's just command line app) and it would be just confusing if we would have another PlusServer GUI app. 


#### 2012-06-15, 01:20:46 - Tamas Ungi
Just an info. PlusServer is the most used application in our lab right now. It runs about 6-8 hours every day. We use it as the absolute front-end of PLUS. So the place of the source code is really strange now.

## #531 fCal does not remember the last directory that data were saved in
When data are recorded and saved under the 'Capturing' tab in fCal, the application does not remember the last directory that data were saved in; if the user is saving multiple recordings to the same folder, each time the user saves a recording they have to (re-) navigate to that same folder (which can be time-consuming).

## #532 Use UTC timestamps for OpenIGTLink messages
The current implementation does not take into account if the sender device uses absolute timestamps in the IGTL message. We need to generate a relative timestamp before we put it into the timestamped buffer. 

See thread: https://www.assembla.com/spaces/plus/messages/1999973

Regarding to the OpenIGTLink documentation (http://www.na-mic.org/Wiki/index.php/OpenIGTLink/Timestamp) IGTL messages are using UTC time. 
Save the UTC start time similar to the Plus start time and always convert timestamp: 
- received in UTC to relative (internal Plus timestamp)
- relative (internal Plus timestamp) to UTC before send

#### 2012-06-20, 13:17:51 - Tamas Heffter
Andras: 
I would compute an offset between the relative time and the absolute time similarly as it is done in vtkSavedDataTracker.cxx. Maybe it could be an option in the image source to enable/disable conversion to relative time. Tomi, would this make sense for you? Could you implement it?

Tamas: 
Actually it needs to be a time synchronization only, and could be automated: When we get the first timestamp we just need to check if it's significantly different than our current timestamp (like diff > mMaxTimeDiff) and if so we can synchronize it with computing the relative time ( mTimeOffset = timestamp - GetCurrentTime(); and then ts = timestamp - mTimeOffset ). Unfortunately this (and probably all approaches) will change the temporal calibration, so after every start we need to re-calibrate the system.

#### 2012-06-20, 13:27:10 - Andras Lasso
Actually, we can do it slightly differently than SavedDataTracker: we can subtract the Plus start time to convert the timestamp to relative ( 0 = Plus start time) from absolute (0 = year 1970). I think the conversion from absolute to relative should be done whenever we receive a timestamp through OpenIGTLink and conversion back to absolute should be done whenever we send any data through OpenIGTLink. If you think this might cause problems for certain applications then it could be a bool option in the OpenIGTLink data sources and broadcaster.

#### 2012-06-20, 14:52:53 - Tamas Heffter
It sounds good, at least it would keep the temporal calibration result. And what about the time elapsed since last reboot? This is the base of our timestamp too, so if somebody using it, than it would make a huge difference again. Is there any way we could identify the different timestamps? What are the most common approaches? We could have a function which could try to identify the type of the timestamp we get, but since it's on a different computer I'm not sure it's going to be easy (like we don't have access to the time since last reboot). 
Or, if the timestamp is computed from year 1970, convert it to our Plus start time (temporal calibration will work), if not, do the previous approach, the first item received going to be the actual Plus time (temporal calibration will be necessary, we can display a warning and compute the relative time respect to the received time). 
Or we can just strictly require an absolute timestamp for OpenIGTLink connections, which would solve all the problem. => This approach will work only with realtime data, no chance to receive older data or run simulator with older timestamps

Thorsten, have you synchronized the clocks in the computers that you use? Probably you have to synchronize the clocks to roughly align the data. Once the clocks are aligned with a maximum of about +/-2 sec difference then you can use temporal calibration to automatically determine the remaining time offset (LocalTimeOffsetSec value in the config file).

#### 2012-06-28, 15:08:37 - Brennecke
I now synchronized the computers via NTP. I think I have some strange behaviors. First I cannot see the tools in the tools state display. When I use the Polaris only without OpenIGTLink IMAGE, this is no Problem. I attach a screenshot to clarify the issue.

Also I cannot initiate the temporal calibration, when I start fCal and wait some more then a minute before connecting the devices. I have to start the connection immediately. Otherwise the start button is disabled. I also attach a log file for this issue.

I can start the temporal calibration, but I'm not sure if this runs correctly. Can you please take a look on this log?

## #533 Add option to set image coordinate system in PlusServer
Right now, images are sent by PlusServer in the Image coordinate system. There could be a --ImageCoordinateSystem='Reference' kind of command line argument if we need the images in the Reference coordinate system. In this case the Image message (OpenIGTLink) would contain the ImageToReference matrix. This could ease use of live images in Slicer.

#### 2012-06-20, 20:45:31 - Andras Lasso
Clarifications after talking with Tamas: What needed is the coordinate frame where the image is defined. Currently it is always the 'Image' coordinate frame, but it's useful if it can be changed. The coordinate frame name should be also reflected in the OpenIGTLink device name. Moreover, the device name should contain some description about the image contents. 

The device name should be generated from the image's name and coordinate frame as: <Name>_<CoordinateFrame>
Default name: UsImage
Default coordinate frame: Image

Examples:
* UsImage_Image (default, image is represented in the raw IJK coordinate frame)
* UsImage_Reference (image is represented in the reference coordinate frame)
* UsImage_Ras

These information could be stored in an 'image' element: <Image Name='UsImage' CoordinateFrame='Reference' />

The 'ImageNames' part is a little undefined now before we have more video streams. I guess when we have more video streams, the Name attribute in the Image tag will identify the stream. Now, it's a little just hanging in the air.

#### 2012-06-25, 15:35:57 - Tamas Ungi
Tomi, what I don't understand is how and why can/should the client change the DeviceName in the Image Message. If we give this freedom to the developers who implement clients, we are giving them a chance to use non-standard message names.

#### 2012-06-25, 19:10:16 - Tamas Heffter
Try to imagine, that multiple clients wants to connect to the server: 
- Client 1 needs 3 images 
- Client 2 needs 1 image

Client 2 doesn't want to receive (and therefore slow down the performance) the other 3 images but the only one it's interested. So it sends a message in the ClientInfo message to send me only that specific image. 

About the device type, it's a good question... Usually the clients are identifying their images by device name, so I think they should be able to set/define the name what they requested (plus they could change it during acquisition). The main idea is that everything needs to be generic because the client won't change their code just to get the data from Plus.

(In r:1839|plus:1839) Re #533: Transform inside the Image Message set. The image still cannot be visualized in Slicer using the RealTimeImaging module. Probably there is a slight difference in the final transform between the Image Message and the ImageToReference set up in Slicer. Therefore the reformat slice and the image content are just intersecting each other rather than being identical.

#### 2012-06-25, 21:40:10 - Tamas Ungi
Tomi, how will the Clients tell PlusServer which video streams they want to receive? The video streams need a name that identifies them. E.g. 'UsImage', 'WebCamera', 'Endoscope'. And the Client will probably need to use these 'standard' names to ask/receive the video streams.
What do you think?

#### 2012-06-26, 04:29:37 - Tamas Ungi
Real time imaging works in Slicer, Just 'Transverse' orientation has to be chosen for the reformat transform.

#### 2012-06-26, 14:51:21 - Tamas Heffter
I think  the example xml defines the image and transform perfectly: 
<Image Name='UsImage' CoordinateFrame='Reference' />

So, it will use the Name attribute instead of the currently hard coded 'UsImage' add a prefix ('_') then concatenate the CoordinateFrame name attribute to define the DeviceName in the IMAGE message. The transform that you need to set in the image message going to be the [Name]To[CoordinateFrame] transform (if it's valid). 

You need to change the Client info accordingly (PlusIgtlClientInfo.h): 



~~~~

/*! Transform names to send with igt image message */ 
PlusTransformName ImageTransformName;  

to 

/*! Transform names to send with igt image message */ 
std::vector<PlusTransformName> ImageTransformNames;

and update the following functions, too: 

 /*! Deserialize client info data from string xml data */ 
  PlusStatus SetClientInfoFromXmlData( const char* strXmlData ); 
  
  /*! Serialize client info data to xml data and return in string */ 
  void GetClientInfoInXmlData( std::string& strXmlData ); 

  /*! Copy all non-pointer data */ 
  void ShallowCopy(const PlusIgtlClientInfo& clientInfo); 
 


~~~~



 So, when you send the image message you need to get the image transforms list something like this (vtkPlusOpenIGTLinkServer.cxx): 



~~~~

// Set image transform name
    PlusTransformName imageTransformName = this->DefaultImageTransformName; 
    if ( client.ImageTransformName.IsValid() )
    {
      imageTransformName = client.ImageTransformName; 
    }

to 

// Set image transform names
    std::vector<PlusTransformName> imageTransformNames = this->DefaultImageTransformNames; 
    if ( !client.ImageTransformNames.empty() )
    {
      imageTransformNames = client.ImageTransformNames; 
    }



~~~~



And modify vtkPlusIgtlMessageFactory.cxx like this: 




~~~~

## #534 STL files are not found if the device set configuration file is moved
If the device set configuration file is saved in a non-default directory then the STL files sometimes are not found. When this happens fCal crashes (not right after starting, but when clicking around, trying to show the 3D view, ...).

1. Need to clean up the STL search paths. Trying to search in parent directory is not acceptable. It may take a very long time and also it does not always work. Need to define a model directory instead.

The output is nicer that with the built-in vtkXMLDataElement::PrintXML, as there are no extra lines, if there are many attributes then each of them is printed on separate line, and matrix elements (those that contain Matrix or Transform in the attribute name and 16 numerical elements in the attribute value) are printed in 4 lines.

Andras:
I'm planning to create a very simple program that reads an old messy XML configuration file and saves a nice one.
Where do you think I should put it (if you think it makes sense to commit something like this un the Plus repo, about which I'm not sure as in the future there will be no messy config files saved by Plus)?

#### 2012-06-25, 20:22:05 - Andras Lasso
Probably there are not too many (if any) config files that are valuable, saved with ugly formatting, and we want to edit. So, I wouldn't spend time with this. Writing the code is quick (maybe 15 lines), but we would need to document and support it, etc.

## #536 Define default models for tools for easier visualization
Define default models and give the possibility to the user to choose among them if they don't have an STL file.
Default freehand and endocavity probe models, needle, stylus etc.
This could be defined as: instead of <DisplayableObject Type='Model' ObjectCoordinateFrame='TransducerOrigin' File='L14-5_38_ProbeModel.stl'...> we could use <DisplayableObject Type='Model' ObjectCoordinateFrame='TransducerOrigin' ModelDefault='FreehandProbe'...>

MD5 checksum computation and checking in OpenIGTLink image messages has a significant impact on the data transfer rate. Add configuration option to enable/disable checksum checking to allow high-frame-rate image transfer through OpenIGTLink.

## #538 Clipping in fCal 3D canvas makes the tools invisible
When the actors are in certain areas relative to the camera, they don't show up. Zooming out rotating shows them.
The used configuration file was the 'No Video + NDI Aurora' with 3 tools and 3 Axis actors for each tool.

#### 2012-07-05, 18:55:53 - Csaba Pinter
The problem is not with the camera settings. When a displayable object having a different type (e.g. Model) is present, this issue does not come up.

Using a different, more reliable representation for axes is needed instead of vtkAxesActor. There is an initial implementation of such actor in Plus that can be improved.

Just for the record, last time I tried, I was able to capture a JPG screenshot using BK OEM interface.

I don't have a need for this functionality though. For the prostate project, our need is to be able to capture RF with camera link and B-mode using framegrabber simultaneously.

#### 2013-01-16, 23:52:02 - Andras Lasso

Yes, we tried this the Friday before SLC and it didn't work. But hopefully that fix that you did the weekend after (as I heard from Csaba and Adam) resolved the problems. 

Also, if I understood correctly from Adam's explanation, it is currently not possible to save multiple streams simultaneously -- it should only be possible to select a stream from fCal.

I will try again this Friday, but I don't know if there will be enough time because we have something else planned in AMIGO -- we have a visitor to try to figure out if our NDI Aurora is functional. I will let you know.

#### 2013-01-17, 01:29:38 - Adam Rankin

We are working on the multi-stream recording, we should have a well-tested solution for next Friday.

There is no receiver class (at least I don't have one) for collecting B-mode through BK OEM interface. What I can test tomorrow is:

2) BK OEM B-mode acquisition using OEM console (no relation to Plus)

#### 2013-03-29, 15:06:41 - Andras Lasso
@fedorov: Some other research groups would need B-mode acquisition through the OEM interface. Do you have a sample code for B-mode acquisition through the OEM interface that works?

#### 2013-03-29, 19:37:01 - Andrey Fedorov
Andras, I have an example code from BK that shows how to capture single frame from OEM. I am no longer at AMIGO, and cannot access that machine remotely, so I will send you that code next week. If I remember correctly, it is very similar to the way we obtain depth and other parameters for the probe. You post a formatted query to OEM TCP socket, and read the response into buffer.

Could you check the queryWrittenSize value?
Does it work if you skip the if (queryWrittenSize!=query.size()) checking and just go on and try to receive the image data anyway?


#### 2013-04-09, 03:38:22 - Andras Lasso
@ben.xkang: Andriy at Brigham and Women's hospital already gave a try to this new class, but the problem was that the image request query  (query:capture_image 'PNG';). sending failed. He didn't have more time for testing and he won't have access to the scanner for a couple of more days, so it would be great if you could investigate this issue. First test if it works as is. If not, then maybe the sending was actually successful, only the return value was incorrect, so try to bypass the (queryWrittenSize!=query.size()) checking and see if the image reception still fails. If it still fails then it would be useful to do step-by-step debugging of the this->Internal->OemClient->Write call to see what goes wrong.

#### 2013-04-11, 14:06:33 - Andrey Fedorov
Ben, you need to enable BK in the CMake (PLUS_USE_BKPROFOCUS_VIDEO)  but keep the BK_USE_PROFOCUS_CAMERALINK flag off. I have not tried this configuration (I have cameralink enabled), but you shouldn't need sapera libraries for using OEM interface. If you have cameralink enabled, you need to point it to the Sapera libraries (they are in PLTools, you need to point CMake to the directories).

Note you will also need to initialize the path to Grabbie libraries in CMake, once you enabled BK.

#### 2013-04-12, 14:29:08 - ben.xkang
@Andrey: Sure I enabled PLUS_USE_BKPROFOCUS_VIDEO and provided the path to Sapera libraries in PLTools.  However, there is no BK_USE_PROFOCUS_CAMERALINK in CMake.  I update the source (PLUS and PLTools) and tried again.  Still no BK_USE_PROFOCUS_CAMERALINK in CMake.  In which CMake file the BK_USE_PROFOCUS_CAMERALINK is defined?


#### 2013-04-12, 15:58:13 - Andras Lasso
We checked this with Ben and it turned out he tried the Plus-1.6 branch that didn't have the option for disabling the CameraLink interface

#### 2013-04-12, 20:26:38 - Andras Lasso
We've tested the OEM interface with Ben and it worked.

However, using the query:capture_image 'PNG' there is a considerable delay and the user interface on the BK becomes less responsive. So, we should use the grab on/off queries instead. Ben will check if he can add this capture mode to the vtkBkProFocusOemVideoSource class.

Also, a small change had to be made in GrabbieLib: The problem was that GrabbieLib tried to get the host information from the IP  address (by using gethostbyaddr). This gethostbyaddr failed with an error message like: the address is valid but no such host can be found. Passing the IP address to gethostbyname instead worked well. So, we changed the code to always get the host by name.

@fedorov: Please test if the connection works correctly on your system after this change (update&rebuild GrabbieLib, then build Plus and see if the connection is OK).

#### 2013-04-12, 20:28:06 - Andras Lasso
If the connection is fine and capturing works through the OEM interface at BWH as well, then we'll close this ticket and create a new one for the performance improvement for Ben.

@fedorov: It would be great if you could test if this works for you. It seemed to work at Children's Hospital, but there were performance issues (frame rate was low and it slowed down the software on the BK machine as well). There is a faster acquisition option (using the grab on/off query), but that may require extra license.

#### 2013-05-07, 13:08:19 - Andrey Fedorov
@lassoan: tested, connects fine. I get about 3.5 fps in release mode. After I connect, cursor on the BK console starts blinking (I don't think I've seen this before). I do not know if any other instabilities/slowdown is introduced. On disconnect fCal crashes.

#### 2013-05-07, 13:08:52 - Andrey Fedorov
After disconnecting (crash), cursor blinking stops.

#### 2013-05-07, 13:32:10 - Andras Lasso
Thanks a lot for the testing. Do you see any error message in the log after the crash? Is there a chance that you can reproduce this in debug mode? (if not, then it's not an issue, then I close this ticket and enter a new ticket just for this disconnect problem)

This 3.5fps acquisition is certainly quite limited, but may be still usable for certain purposes. Also, I think the continuous acquisition (grab on/off command) requires extra license, while this kind of grabbing does not. The responsiveness/stability of the BK scanner software may be improved if we set the frame rate to 1-2fps.

#### 2013-05-07, 14:17:43 - Andrey Fedorov
I had to stop because they needed the scanner for the neuro case, also was not able to test the cameralink parameters readout, which is actually a lot more important for me. Will try to get some time on it later this week again...

Andras, I would also mention somewhere in the documentation for Plus BK OEM the issue about blinking cursor. If I was to use this mode of acquisition, I would first spend time to make sure it does not introduce any issues on the BK console. I think it is fair to warn the users.

#### 2013-05-07, 16:00:59 - Andras Lasso
I mention BK OEM limitations on the Hardware_setup page, added a comment to the sample BK OEM config file, and describe the performance issue in #754. Let me know if you think we should add more info about this to anywhere.

#### 2013-05-07, 21:38:37 - Andrey Fedorov
Andras, this looks good. In addition to that, the cursor is blinking, but maybe it's a non-relevant detail.


## #543 PlusServer probably not sending messages in order of timestamp
When we send more than one OpenIGTLink message from the PlusOpenIGTLinkServer, the receiving client occasionally gets older messages after more recent ones. When we set MaxNumberOfIgtlMessagesToSend='1' in the PlusOpenIGTLinkServer config xml element, the broadcasted transforms don't randomly jump back to older positions. So the problem is probably that when more than one message is sent, they are not sent in the order of timestamps.
Since there is a workaround by setting MaxNumberOfIgtlMessagesToSend to 1, the priority of this issue is low.

#### 2012-07-12, 02:39:37 - Tamas Ungi
First step in debugging this issue could be to record incoming transform messages using Transform Recorder. After stopping Slicer in debug mode, the transform series could be observed and checked if the time stamps are in order or not.

## #544 Make Ulterius shared memory transfer configurable using the device set configuration file
Currently the SharedMemoryStatus flag in vtkSonixVideoSource cannot be set using the device set configuration. Add a 'UseSharedMemory' attribute to the 'ImageAcquisition' element and connect it to the value of vtkSonixVideoSource::SharedMemoryStatus in vtkSonixVideoSource::ReadConfiguration and vtkSonixVideoSource::WriteConfiguration.


#### 2012-07-09, 20:15:36 - Siavash Khallaghi
We (Saman and I) wanted to add this feature to Plus a long time ago (around November 2011). Because we did not want to mess things up with configuration files, we added a member variable, *SharedMemoryStatus*, to vtkSonixVideoSource defined in line 349 vtkSonixVideoSource.h and a Set/Get macro which we called prior to the InternalConnect() in our own application.

If it is not too much trouble, I would like to ask you guys to support the Set/Get macro, defined in line 259 of vtkSonixVideoSource.h.

Thanks

#### 2012-07-09, 20:36:04 - Andras Lasso
This ticket is about get/set the flag from the device set config. The implementation is exactly the same as all other configuration parameters in the video source (values are read/written from the config files and can be set using get/set macros), so it's difficult to mess anything up.

Siavash, if you have time then it would be great if you could add these few lines yourself, it should take less than an hour, including testing.
We planned to implement it once we've completed all the 1.5.4 items.

* ImageCoordinateFrame='Image' and ProbeCoordinateFrame='Probe' is not required for capturing
* CoordinateDefinitions are not required for capturing
* When there is an error condition then the text above the 'Snapshot' button should be orange or red and/or an warning or error icon should be displayed there.

## #551 Segfault when disconnecting the BK video source
Very often when the BK video source is disconnected fCal crashes with a segfault. It seems that the PlusBkProFocusReceiver::DataAvailable(int lines, int pitch, void const* frameData) callback is called by Sapera after the frame receiver object is destroyed. Probably the order of disconnecting/destroying frame receivers is not correct in vtkBkProFocusVideoSource::InternalDisconnect() or some stop or destroy step is missed.

#### 2012-07-13, 16:13:58 - Andras Lasso
Andriy, it's specific to the BK system, so it would be good if you could have a look at it yourself, but we can also plan a remote debugging session sometime.

(In r:1929|plus:1929) re #551:

It seems that the function AcquisitionGrabberSapera::StopGrabbing() does not properly abort the transfer. 

Here's how it is done in AcquisitionGrabberSapera::StopGrabbing():

    BOOL result = saperaTransfer->Freeze();
    saperaTransfer->Wait(500);



And this is the code from AcquisitionGrabberSapera::Destroy():

     BOOL result = saperaTransfer->Freeze();
     if( saperaTransfer->Wait(500) != TRUE)
     {
         saperaTransfer->Abort();
      }

What is done in StopGrabbing() but not in Destroy(), is the cleanup of the injector:

    saperaProcessor->GetAcquisitionInjector()->CleanupInjection();

Demo_AcquisitionLibrary does not use stopGrabbing() at all, just Destroy().

So the solution could be not to use StopGrabbing(), but just Destroy().

With the changes in this commit, I am able to connect/disconnect repeatedly and close fCal without crash.

## #552 Linear scan conversion with BK 8848 sagittal array is wrong
From Andriy:
Sagittal array does not behave well. When I do the reconstruction with 40 mm (the value you had originally), it looks ok, but squeezed a bit.
When I change to 60 mm (which seems to be the width of the array), it looks like it for a moment shows correct image, but then very quickly looks like voxels increase in the LR dimension, and I have in the end the screenshot attached.

## #553 Retrieve BK scan conversion parameters from the OEM interface
Currently, the parameters used in reconstructions (angles, depth) should be specified in the configuration file. Since they are available via the OEM interface, it would make sense to instead query them from Plus and then store them in the captured RF header file or in the XML config file.

#### 2012-07-16, 17:17:50 - Andras Lasso
Scan conversion parameters would be much simpler to be saved in the device set configuration file, similarly to other acquisition parameters.
It would be better to move the RfProcessing params elemtn under the video source element in the config file and make it the VideoSource's responsibility to read/write the RfProcessing element.

Current issues:

1) Need to figure out what is the meaning of the parameter names provided by OEM. Currently, for 8848 curved transducer we have this:

Start line X: 0.00933471 mm
Start line Y: -0.00658264 mm
Start angle: 19.6185 deg
Start depth: -0.0196801 mm
Stop line X: -0.00933471 mm
Stop line Y: -0.00658264 mm
Stop angle: 160.381 deg
Stop depth: 53.6878 m

for the linear array:

Start line X: 0.0302374 mm
Start line Y: -5.82077e-011 mm
Start angle: 90 deg
Start depth: -0.0287255 mm
Stop line X: -0.0302374 mm
Stop line Y: -5.82077e-011 mm
Stop angle: 90 deg
Stop depth: 55.9246 m

I can only make sense of Stop depth (depth) and angles.

2) currently setting of the parameters on RfProcessor is somewhat cumbersome, since it actually has to pass the recon parameters to individual processors, which are not exposed to VideoSource.

3) there are a lot of very important parameters that can be queried from OEM, need to look what can be set and where. For example, need to look if transducer model can be set somehow. It is available in the config file, but probably should be reset when known from OEM.

#### 2012-08-10, 15:42:46 - Andras Lasso
1) The Start/Stop line parameters didn't seem to make any sense. Maybe you could ask BK about them.

2) Probably the simplest would be to add GetBrightnessConverter() and GetScanConverter() methods to RfProcessor and set the parameters by rfProcessor->GetScanConverter()->SetImagingDepthMm(150.0);

3) In vtkBkProFocusVideoSource::InternalConnect() you can get the parameters from the scanner, store them in member variables (you can overwrite the members that previously has been set in vtkBkProFocusVideoSource::ReadConfiguration), and when the config file is saved you can save those member variables (by writing it into the XML data element in vtkBkProFocusVideoSource::WriteConfiguration)

#### 2012-08-17, 14:00:05 - Andrey Fedorov
(In r:1998|plus:1998) Re #553: added saving of the addition acquisition parameters.

Transducer name is saved as 'BK-<model number><scan plane>'. For 8848, scan plane can be either S or T. TransducerName attribute is added to RfProcessor, since it manages saving of that tag.

TransducerWidth initialization is added. BK OEM interface QUERY_SCANAREA returns Start/Stop Line X/Y in m. Start/StopLineX appear to be defined relative to the center of the active are of the transducer and are used to set transducer width (for linear probe only). Note that changing width on the console results in the change of Start/StopLineX (for sagittal array) and in the change of Start/StopLineAngle (for transverse). These changes can now be correctly captured via OEM interface. Tested passing to fCal configuration file that corresponds to S, while active surface was T, RfProcessor was correctly initialized.

TODO: Probably we need a bit smarter initialization of the reconstructed image size based on the dimensions of the scanned area and the width of the RF line. I will ask BK how we can query the RF line physical width, cannot find this in OEM specs. 


#### 2012-08-17, 14:07:29 - Andrey Fedorov
Correction: since we know the number of lines and samples for RF, and also the physical dimensions of the scanned area, this should be sufficient for estimating the pixel size of the reconstructed image, no additional data is needed from OEM.

#### 2012-08-17, 14:20:55 - Andrey Fedorov
I just realized the dimensions for reconstruction are not important, since these are used only for visualization in fCal, the original data is saved in full as RF.

@fedorov: A slight change has been made in the config file structure last week (see https://www.assembla.com/code/plus/subversion/node/diff/1969/2009/trunk/PlusLib/data/ConfigFiles/PlusConfiguration_BkProFocus_OpenIGTLinkTracker.xml) and due to a bug the fCal didn't recover nicely from reading a non-conforming config file. @rankin is fixing the bug to avoid crash regardless of the config file structure. I've created the ... updated 01 config file by applying the same changes that were done to the example config files. It should work with the current code, but let us know if it does not.

#### 2012-08-28, 21:01:27 - Adam Rankin
Crash has been fixed. Displayable objects now require IDs. IDs are defined as an attribute in a <DisplayableObject> tag.

fCal requires the following tags for:
- hiding/showing the phantom
<fCal
...
PhantomModelId='PhantomModel'
/>
- updating the volume after reconstruction
<fCal
...
ReconstructedVolumeId='Volume'
/>

#### 2012-08-28, 21:36:12 - Andrey Fedorov
Confirmed, the crash is resolved.

The next issue is the updated code does not correctly reconstruct b-mode in fCal. See screenshot attached. Andras, I think this may be related to the cleanup you did -- do you know what's wrong?

#### 2012-08-28, 22:33:17 - Andras Lasso
Most probably I interpreted the 'sample' argument of PlusBkProFocusReceiver::Prepare incorrectly (I thought that sample refers to the number of samples in the line, but from the attached image it seems that it refers to the length of line in bytes). Sorry for introducing this regression, I've committed a fix, hopefully it works correctly now.

r2037 seems to fix the earlier issue.

The next issue is that the depth of the b-mode image shown in fCal does not match the depth of the image on the BK console (will attach screenshots). I believe this is a new issue, I think I checked the depth was matching in my earlier experiments. I will look into this, but Andras please let me know if you have any specific ideas.

It seems that the line length is not computed correctly.

Check the numberOfRfSamplesPerLine computation in PlusBkProFocusReceiver::Prepare.

After the cleanup it was:
(1) int numberOfRfSamplesPerLine = (samples-HEADER_SIZE_BYTES/BYTES_PER_SAMPLE) / m_Decimation;

then you had that error and I've found some documentation that indicated that samples is defined in bytes, so I changed it to:
(2) int numberOfRfSamplesPerLine = (samples-HEADER_SIZE_BYTES) / BYTES_PER_SAMPLE / m_Decimation;

It may be possible that samples is defined in 16-bit samples instead of bytes, so (1) is correct. So, please try to compute the numberOfRfSamplesPerLine as (1).

(In r:2039|plus:2039) re #553: the 'sample' from BK in Prepare() is 16-bit. Updated the code to use this convention. Verified agreement between the fCal reconstructed image and the BK console image (to be attached to the issue). The artifact at the F edge of the reconstructed image is still present (TODO).


#### 2012-08-29, 18:44:07 - Andras Lasso
Great!

For the artifact at the F edge, check the comment in PlusBkProFocusReceiver.cxx:

    // TODO: check if header->LineLength can be used to make the numberOfSamplePairsToCopy computation more accurate
    // (now there might be junk pixels at the end of the line if the line lenght is different for different lines) 

For computing the number of samples in input we use the pitch now:
int numberOfSamplePairsInInput=((pitch-HEADER_SIZE_BYTES)/(2*BYTES_PER_SAMPLE))/m_Decimation;

we could try to use the header->LineLength:
int numberOfSamplePairsInInput=((header->LineLength-HEADER_SIZE_BYTES)/(2*BYTES_PER_SAMPLE))/m_Decimation;

#### 2012-08-30, 17:02:18 - Andrey Fedorov
Andras, I forgot we have a biopsy case today, so I was in AMIGO and had some time to look into this.

The number of samples in the same for each line, so this was not an issue. What I also found is that the (pitch - header) had few samples more than what was passed to Prepare(). It looks like there are some samples in the buffer that are not properly initialized, and that's why we have this issue. If I reduce the number of samples, at some point I am able to get rid of the artifact.

Interestingly, I did some experiments with the phantom, and it looks like we  are getting artifacts in the area that shows correctly on BK b-mode console.

Having said all of this, I actually think the issue is very minor, since we do not expect important data to be on the edge of the image. It might be interesting to resolve this, but I do not consider it is worth the effort. That's why I am closing the issue. Please reopen if you think this is important.

## #555 Transform in OpenIGTLink image message should be used
In the OpenIGTLinkVideo type of ImageAcquisition, the transform in the OpenIGTLink IMAGE message is dropped now. It should rather be recorded in the TrackedFrame (that is generated from the IMAGE message). To define the transform name for this transform, an extra parameter should be added to the ImageAcquisition config tag. E.g. ImageCoordinateFrame='Reference'. This would mean that the the transform in the IMAGE message is loaded in the TrackedFrame as 'ImageToReference' transform.

Note that OpenIGTLink has a strange interpretation of the image transform. To stay compatible with Slicer, the transform in the image should treat the center of the image as the origin.

#### 2012-07-17, 16:40:57 - Andras Lasso
Instead of ImageCoordinateFrame='Reference' use EmbeddedTransformName='ImageToReference' - or whatever attribute name is used in #556.

Yes, transforms are embedded in the image.

#### 2012-08-23, 12:56:17 - Tamas Ungi
I've never used the OpenIGTLinkVideo as an image acquisition method. I fixed a similar issue #557 with this change: https://www.assembla.com/code/plus/subversion/changesets/1932

#### 2012-08-23, 13:37:29 - Tamas Heffter
In the OpenIGTLinkVideoSource, we just use the image data _without_ the transform field. We can reconstruct a plus transform name from the IGT image message transform name if it's available and add it as a custom field (like we do with TRACKEDFRAME message.

## #556 Rename OpenIGTLinkServer Image coordinate frame attribute name
Currently the transform name that is embedded into the IMAGE message is defined by the CoordinateFrame='Reference' attribute:

  <PlusOpenIGTLinkServer ...> 
    <DefaultClientInfo> 
    <ImageNames>
      <Image Name='Image' CoordinateFrame='Reference' />
    </ImageNames>
    </DefaultClientInfo>
  </PlusOpenIGTLinkServer>

The problem is that the 'CoordinateFrame' word does not define the role of the attribute, only the type (that it is some kind of coordinate frame).

The attribute should be renamed to EmbeddedTransformName and should contain the full transform name:

  <PlusOpenIGTLinkServer ...> 
    <DefaultClientInfo> 
    <ImageNames>
      <Image Name='Image' *EmbeddedTransformToFrame='Reference'* />
    </ImageNames>
    </DefaultClientInfo>
  </PlusOpenIGTLinkServer>

#### 2012-07-17, 19:49:54 - Tamas Ungi
There is no space in PlusIgtlClientInfo to hold a full transform. It only defines a 'CoordinateFrame'. So fixing this is more complicated.

assigned_to_id: changed from "ungi" to null

#### 2012-07-17, 22:34:15 - Tamas Heffter
Why do we need the full transform name? Isn't going to be the from frame always the same as the Image Name attribute? 

#### 2012-07-17, 22:44:54 - Andras Lasso
Although we would most of the time embed an 'ImageToSomething' transform, we could embed any transform name we need. I like EmbeddedTransformName='ImageToReference' because it is short and clear. EmbeddedTransformToFrame='Reference' is not too bad either.

If there are something that prohibits the use of EmbeddedTransformName then we can use EmbeddedTransformToFrame.

#### 2012-07-17, 23:11:03 - Tamas Heffter
The only thing is that it's not going to be consistent with the current frame attributes (and therefore we could have the same errors as before with the transform names, however we could check if it's valid or not). I can implement it if needed. 


#### 2012-07-18, 03:08:50 - Tamas Ungi
I currently cannot imagine any case when the 'From' part would be anything else than the Image Name.
Another complication with explicit 'From' part is that it would be a logical consequence to put the full transform name in the Device Name of the image message. But OpenIGTLink allows max. 20 characters for Device Name. So 'Image_ImageToReference' cannot be a Device Name. It's better to have 'Image_Reference'. Then, at least we know that we have to put it on 'ReferenceToRAS' to display the image in RAS. Just 'Image' is not enough.

So this is really just the renaming of the attribute and the member names in the code (to stay consistent). It could be kept as a low priority issue.

#### 2012-07-18, 11:57:54 - Andras Lasso
OK, so due to the max. length limitation rename the attribute name to EmbeddedTransformToFrame.  The same name should be used in #555.

This should be changed ASAP, because if we do it later then there are going to be many config files with the old name.

## #557 Image transform not according to OpenIGTLink protocol

## #558 Make SegmentationParameterDialog more robust
While testing fCal with PlusConfiguration_DataCollectionOnly_File and tried to open the segmentation dialog the SegmentationParameterDialog::resizeEvent(QResizeEvent* aEvent) crashed because m_ImageVisualizer was NULL.

If possible, create all vtkObjects in the constructor and initialize them as much as possible (you can set up connections, etc.), and delete them in the destructor. That way it's much easier to make sure that all the pointers point to valid objects.  In general, we should not have Initialize...() methods, because the object is very fragile between the constructor and the Initialize method call. Also, it's not clear if Initialize can be called multiple times or if Initialize shall be called when certain member variables are changed. => These comments are valid for all fCal classes, not just for the segmentation parameter dialog.


#### 2012-07-19, 12:46:28 - Csaba Pinter
All of the Initialize() functions in the fCal classes are for handling the event when a certain toolbox becomes active. Probably it's time to rename these functions.
In the CommonWidgets, ToolStateDisplayWidget is the only one that has something similar, except for the ones mentioned. I'll look into that one.

#### 2012-07-19, 13:13:32 - Andras Lasso
Having methods that are called when on toolbox activation/deactivation is good. It's just have to be renamed to Activate/Deactivate, OnActivate/OnDeactivate, or something similar. I would create all objects in the constructor because NULL checks have to be added in every method call that use objects that are not created in the constructor.

#### 2012-07-19, 13:34:39 - Csaba Pinter
I agree, they are better names. By the way, no objects are created in those functions.

#### 2012-07-20, 16:06:05 - Adam Rankin
In general, I have gone back and restructured things to be created at construction time. The only 'Initialize' functions that remain are class internal functions for initializing objects.

## #560 fCal error messages in simulation modes

## #561 Objects without valid ObjectToWorld transformation show up in 3D
Only those objects should appear that have a valid ...ToWorld transform.

I connected to SonixTouch w/ GPS and all the tools and the image appeared at the world 0,0,0, when there was no calibration matrix present. The image should not appear without ImageToProbe transform, the stylus (assigned to the Stylustip coordinate frame) without StylustipToStylus and so on. It would be easiest to check the ObjectToWorld transform in the transform repository. If it's invalid, then hide the object.

#### 2012-07-25, 22:30:05 - Andras Lasso
Actually, there are 3 states:
-object position is not known at all (not all the required transforms are available): probably the best is to not show the object
-object position is invalid (all the required transforms are available, but the transform is invalid, e.g., the tracker is out of view): probably the best is to show the object with a different representation (e.g., surface model in red and semitransparent; image with a red border and semitransparent)
-object position is valid: show it normally

It may be possible that the this->Ult.getDataDescriptor((uData)this->AcquisitionDataType, this->DataDescriptor) method returns an invalid DataDescriptor (that results in a computed buffer size=0) if it is called too quickly after the previous ulterius call.

A potential solution could be to wait a bit and retry a few times the getDataDescriptor call if the detect the computed buffer size is 0.

## #567 Control frame size through Ulterius
If different image size is acquired from an Ultrasonix machine between calibration and data collection. The calibration will be invalid. To prevent such accidents, the image size setting could be defined in the config file, and set through Ulterius. I don't know if it's possible yet.

#### 2012-08-04, 01:04:44 - Tamas Ungi
I couldn't find this option without doubt in the imaging presets config file of the exam software. Somebody should ask Ultrasonix.

#### 2012-08-04, 01:43:56 - Andras Lasso
One possible way to find out before asking in the research forum: make a copy of all files in the exam software directory, start the exam software, change the image size, exit exam software, compare all files to the backed up files. If there is any difference between the files it may be the parameter that we should set through ulterius.

OK, I see. Unfortunately there is one problem with this implementation: a DisplayableObject cannot identified by its ObjectCoordinateFrame. Several objects may refer to the same coordinate frame and you don't know which of them is the specific one that you want to show/hide.

If we want to identify an element then we have to define an 'Id' attribute. Then you can use the find child element by Id method to get the element.

Could you change the implementation to something like the following?

<DisplayableObject Id='Phantom' Type='Model' ObjectCoordinateFrame='Phantom'...      />
...
<fCal PhantomDisplayableObjectId='Phantom' .... />

This is an interesting issue. Last time I imported a reconstructed volume in Slicer, it didn't appear in the correct position either. I thought it was a RAS-LPS conflict, and I didn't really care. But we are planning to use reconstructed volumes for needle navigation in the near future, so this has to be fixed.

#### 2012-08-09, 04:17:18 - Andras Lasso
When you load the volume into Slicer then it's an RAS-LPS conversion only, which has to be fixed in Slicer (see http://www.na-mic.org/Bug/view.php?id=2173).

The volume reconstruction looks OK, most likely just the reconstructed surface model is represented in an incorrect coordinate system. It used to work correctly, so probably it's a regression that has been introduced recently.

(In r:2007|plus:2007) Fixed #569

Essentially, the reconstructed volume is created in the reference object coordinate frame. This was fine when the world coordinate frame was the same as the reference coordinate frame (as is the case in most config files). However, in the given config file the world coordinate frame is 'Tracker' which breaks the visualization of the volume.

The solution was to create a displayable object attached to a coordinate frame to correct the missing transform. Now, simply create a displayable object of type polyData in the reference coordinate frame and assign it an ID.

Example:
<DisplayableObject Type='PolyData' ObjectCoordinateFrame='Reference' Id='Volume'/>

Then, in the config file section 'VolumeReconstruction' you must tell it which ID is used to display the reconstructed volume.

Example:
<VolumeReconstruction
    ...
    VolumeDisplayableObjectId='Volume'
    ...
</>

## #570 Micron Tracker - Markers go in and out of view rapidly
The tool state goes in and out of view rapidly. The status message flickers between 'Ok' and 'Missing'. I am confident that the markers are being tracked without the jitter. I tested with the previous version of fCal (most probably, June release) and this issue does not occur.

## #571 Clean up MicronTracker interface classes
MicronTracker tracking seems to work fine, but the interface classes (PlusLib\\src\  racking\\MicronTracking\\Utils) are implemented very poorly. Need a review and clean-up including:
* VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAMMING NOTE in MicronTrackerInterface.cpp
* check ownedByMe handling (probably it should be set to false if the handle is not created by new)
* consistent return values (sometimes int, sometimes bool; sometimes non-zero means error, sometimes 0, false)
* check timestamp computation (mtGetLatestFrameTime(cam) function can provide accurate enough without filtering)

There also seem to be a larger time lag in the tracking in Plus than in the MicronTracker CPP demo.

## #573 Make sure the L14-5 probe model is correctly oriented in the 3D view
According to discussions with Elvis Chen, the STL model may be not oriented well in fCal's 3D view.
It is necessary to check if the L14-5 probe model is oriented the good way (the marked side points to the same side of the phantom in reality and in the fCal).
If it is rotated, the ModelToObject transform needs to be changed in every config file that shows the L14-5 probe.

## #580 US parameters to be stored in mha files
When we record a tracked frame list, some ultrasound imaging parameters might be forgotten, and they would be important in later processing. Depth, soundvelocity, sector size, BMode/RF etc. These extra parameters could be added to the mha file headers.

#### 2012-08-31, 11:31:55 - Andras Lasso
We already store most of these parameters in the config file that is saved along with each mha file. The XML format is more flexible, better structured, easier to edit, and can be directly used to acquire images again with the same settings. If we keep the XML then saving into the mha is redundant (and it will be unclear which info will be used if you do some processing, etc.). If we don't save an XML then we may lose some details that are hard to save into (tag=value) format.

We might save the xml line-by-line into the mha header, e.g.,
AcquisitionConfigXml_001=<PlusConfig...>
AcquisitionConfigXml_002= <DataCollection...>
...
However, this way we may need an additional step to extract the XML to reuse for new acquisitions and retrieval of parameters is quite complex (require mha parsing, composition of the xml string, xml parsing, and retrieval params from the xml tree).

Do you have any specific use case?


#### 2012-08-31, 11:51:16 - Tamas Ungi
My case is the following: I recorded a tracked frame list with a config file where the depth was not set explicitly (depth=-1). Later, I wanted to process this recorded data, but I forgot what depth was used on the US machine. In the saved config file I just see depth=-1, which doesn't help.

I am also recording RF data for a tissue characterization project. I assume they will need not only the depth but all the other parameters too, that we almost never set explicitly in the config file.

#### 2012-08-31, 12:28:38 - Andras Lasso
The current solution to both use cases is the following:
* If the parameter (e.g., depth) can be specified for the US device: the user should specify it in the XML, the video source will use it for initializing the acquisition and will be also saved in the output.
* If the parameter cannot be specified for the US device but it can be obtained from the US device: the video source should obtain it and save it to the XML when WriteConfiguration() is called (see an example in the vtkBkProFocusVideoSource.cxx: upon Connect() the class collects some info from the US system and sets it into the RF processor object and it is also saved into the XML in WriteConfiguration()).
* If the parameter cannot be specified for the US device and cannot be obtained from the US device: the user should specify it in the XML, it may be used within the application, and will be saved in the XML as well.

Depth=-1 is a poor practice. All the parameters that can be specified for the US device should be specified explicitly to allow exact reproduction of the acquisition later.

If there is a way to query the imaging depth from the US device then the video source should do it (probably in Connect()). Would this solve your problem?

* We already do something similar in vtkSonixVolumeReader (I needed it for the MUSiiC library), we basically just save all the imaging parameters to the tracked frame as a custom frame field and read it at PlusUsMessage::SetTrackedFrame method if available: 



~~~~

trackedFrame.SetCustomFrameField('SonixTransmitFrequency', strTransmitFrequency.str()); 
trackedFrame.SetCustomFrameField('SonixSamplingFrequency', strSamplingFrequency.str()); 
...
 if ( this->m_TrackedFrame.IsCustomFrameFieldDefined('SonixTransmitFrequency') )
{
...
}

~~~~


 
* The other thing in my mind is unfortunately you cannot force the user to use the same depth you have in the config file, because you can override that setting from the US console (and in the OR looks like they do it pretty often). We can still check the depth every time we receive a frame and either modify the config file (you can have different depth recordings, so it's not a good practice) or save it to each tracked frame  (since you can change the imaging parameters any time, maybe this would be the most adequate solution). 


#### 2012-08-31, 14:59:32 - Csaba Pinter
It is also not good practice to change the image settings _in course_ of image acquisition, because then the captured data becomes inconsistent.
I would have the application stop the recording process when an imaging parameter is changed during capturing, and allow saving the data collected so far along with a configuration file containing the paramterers present at the time the user started the recording.

#### 2012-08-31, 15:08:23 - Tamas Heffter
We used to have a plan to fulfill this inconsistent data in the buffer problem by checking the largest image size in the buffer and save all the images with that size (with a black frame around it)  with the original frame size as an custom frame field (so, on read we can crop the image to the original size if we want). This is a step forward to the multiple streams approach (#461). But actually the image size won't change if we change the depth, however it could change if we change the display parameter in the admin (full screen vs normal or something like that). 

#### 2012-08-31, 15:35:08 - Andras Lasso
There are two separate discussions:
1. Where to store data. Probably we all agree that we should keep storing per-frame data in the metafile and all constant data in the XML config file.
2. What data to acquire: what data (depth, sector size, etc.) to acquire, what frequency (constant for the sequence or per-frame), on what device.

@ungi:
Do you have any issue with where we store the data (1)?
Do you have any specific need for acquiring more data (2)? If yes, please specify what data you need, with what frequency, on which imaging device.


#### 2012-08-31, 15:48:40 - Tamas Ungi
1.
Yes, we all agree that parameters that don't change during image acquisition should be stored in the XML and parameters that change should be stored in the mha with custom fields for each frame.

2.
Although most US acquisition cases could theoretically be accomplished with fixed imaging parameters, we cannot guarantee that the depth knob won't be turned during acquisition. Along with all the other parameters that have knobs on the US console. Focus, gain, etc. So all these should ideally be stored along with the frames.


#### 2012-08-31, 16:53:50 - Andras Lasso
Of course it would be nice to always store all information, but the implementation workload can be significant and collecting lots of data may impact the performance. So, we can just deal with very specific needs (specific data, frequency, imaging device).

So, I close this ticket for now and you can enter separate tickets for any specific needs (such as you did for depth in #582).

## #581 PlusApp automatic GUI tests sometimes fail
By andreistate on Aug 31 @ 02:39am
PlusApp-bin\\BuildAndTest.bat can fail even though generated code is likely fine
The above batch file is normally run from a command window. On a system with more than one display monitor, if that command window is located on a non-primary monitor, tests 1, 3, and 4 fail, possibly because the program windows open on the same non-primary monitor the command window is on.

Second issue; independently of the number of monitors (so even with a single monitor), if one uses a non-Wndows-7 desktop theme (such as Windows Classic), at a minimum tests 1 and 4 will fail.

This should help reproduce the above behavior:

Unfortunately we have lots of issues with the GUI tests and it is very unreliable. I applied many fixes (mostly workarounds for problems they claimed to fix), but they only partially help apparently.
Although the project owner keeps telling me (in the answers to my emails) that the Sikuli project is still alive, the website and the environment has not been touched since last September.
Maybe it is time to discuss whether we should continue using Sikuli.

By Andras Lasso on Aug 31 @ 10:11am
@pinter: Can you drop an email to the Sikuli guys, asking about solutions for the specific problems we have?
* The lack of robustness in text recognition seems to be a Sikuli issue that we could report.
* Are the multi-screen issues caused by a Sikuli bug that we should report (or could be an enhancement request for a multi-screen Find function)?
* Can we report the theming related problem to Sikuli or we should implement it differently (using OCR instead of finding graphics, adding alternative graphics, increase the tolerance...)?

#### 2012-08-31, 14:16:08 - Csaba Pinter
* Inability to perform when screen is locked under Windows

#### 2012-10-09, 15:45:20 - Csaba Pinter
We reached the decision to stop using Sikuli for GUI testing.

What shall we do with this issue:
* Leave the tests in PlusApp for the time being
* Remove them altogether
?

#### 2012-10-09, 18:25:25 - Andras Lasso
I've talked to Sonia about it. She doesn't have any update on Sikuli, but Kitware pushes the QtTesting project instead, so if we want use a tool that is properly support then probably we should try QtTesting.

I would suggest not to remove QtTesting until we add similar tests using QtTesting.

#### 2012-10-09, 18:26:34 - Csaba Pinter
Agreed.

I create a ticket for it then.

## #582 Adaptation to parameter changes in PlusServer
The depth is frequently changed during US-guided interventions. Since we have different ImageToProbe matrices for each depth, stored in different config files, the PlusServer should be restarted now at each change in depth. This takes unacceptably long time during interventions.

A possible solution: ImageToProbe matrices could be stored for every possible depth in one config file. PlusServer could always apply the one for the actual depth parameter.

#### 2012-08-31, 16:06:02 - Tamas Heffter
I agree, plus server should be able to choose between different configuration files, and more over, it should send the transform repository persistent transforms as a transform repository message (or within the tracked frame message) to the connected clients if they requested. 

#### 2012-08-31, 16:23:28 - Tamas Ungi
How would choosing between config files work?
I only thought of adding extra attributes to matrices in the transform repository. As we store now date, time and error, we could store depth, zoom, and frequency (and any other parameters that may change image geometry). And PlusServer could choose between these (from one transform repository).

If these attributes are not given, we can give a warning, and just send the any of the given ImageToProbe transforms for backwards compatibility. (In old config files, only one is given anyways.)

#### 2012-08-31, 16:49:42 - Andras Lasso
The need is clear: allow changing image depth without connect/reconnect.

I would suggest to use a different image stream for each depth (or any other configuration setting), because it is very hard (if not impossible) to synchronize multiple pipelines where information can abruptly change at anytime (you cannot interpolate between abrupt changes, so an infinitely small time difference can cause a large position change, etc.).

We need to have a 'master' configuration file anyway, so we can just as well (and for simplicity we should) store all information related to a procedure in one XML file.

So, the proposed implementation:
* Have one XML config file.
* Define multiple output streams for the imaging device: one for each supported depth. Example: UsImageDepth40, UsImageDepth50, UsImageDepth60.
* Define a separate calibration matrix for each stream. Example: UsImageDepth40ToProbe, UsImageDepth50ToProbe, UsImageDepth60ToProbe.
* Implement a 'switcher' device that can automatically redirect multiple _synchronized_ input streams to one virtual output stream. There wouldn't be any mixing, synchronization, etc. just pure forwarding, so having discrete switches would not cause any problem. The output of the switcher could replace the different inputs (e.g., UsImageDepth40ToTracker -> UsImageToTrackerl; either defined manually or performed automatically), so a single image/transform name could be broadcasted.

#### 2012-08-31, 16:52:14 - Tamas Heffter
This approach sounds good to me, but not sure Transform repository is ready for these custom fields (it needs to now which transform to use). 
What if we add another xml structure to store all the different calibration results and on pre-defined settings change (like depth) we just update the current transform repository with the right calibration file.  For this, data collector should get a notification to update transform repository (and it needs to have access to transform repository) with transform selected.

#### 2012-08-31, 16:59:23 - Andras Lasso
It would make the programs extremely complicated if a transform could not be defined by its (from,to) name.

Instead of changing the transform repository we can just let the switcher update the transform names. The switcher can easily do that by creating an alias in the transform repo: AxialPlaneToAxialPlaneDepth40=[identity].


#### 2012-08-31, 17:14:00 - Tamas Heffter
I like Andras' approach, however it will take a while we could implement it (it depends on the stream based data collection). 
@pinter Do you have any estimate when could you finish the task #461?

PlusServer is only used for testing now, so 'q' button limitation is not relevant anymore.
Gnuplot should be replaced by vtk charting (see #644).

Remaining task would be the improvement of HW devices support. Instead of having a generic ticket for that, add tickets for each specific HW device on request.

## #592 Pattern recognition mysteriously fails sometimes

The problem is with the permutation generator in the FidLabeling::FindPattern function. If the right combination is the last one, e.g. combination (3,2,1) in case of 4 line candidates, it is not examined, so not recognized.

Hi Andras,

In the CMakeLists.txt of the PlusBuild trunk
https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/plus/trunk/PlusBuild/CMakeLists.txt

in the paragraph of 

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Specify target dependencies
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
it says:

IF ( NOT ITK_DIR )
  # ITK_DIR is not supplied, so it is built inside Plus, therefore we need to specify dependencies to make sure it is built early enough
  SET(ITK_DEPENDENCIES)
  LIST(APPEND PlusLib_DEPENDENCIES vtk)

Line 268 should perhaps be:

## #596 Saving several GB large files sometimes fails
> 1) most critical problem: when we set fCal in continuous capturing during sagittal sweep, and then try to save the resulting dataset, very often fCal would crash. With the sweep settings they use, we end up with 700-800 RF frames. I tried reducing capturing rate to 15 FPS and experimenting with the number of frames to get the threshold, but the problem seems to be random -- sometime it would crash with 250 frames, sometime after 400. During the patient study we captured several sections during the sweep 200-300 frames each. Even with those sections, the size of MHA file is several Gb. Is it possible to set the mode to save each frame separately? Could this be because of some OS issues dealing with very large files?

This version we used was built in 64-bit Debug mode. I will build in Release and will let you know. The crash was actually reproducible with 'air scan' at full sweep -- we tried it before the patient was in, and that's when we found it.

#### 2012-09-17, 18:01:54 - Andras Lasso
Tested with simulated image source ('Simulation mode for freehand spatial calibration with phantom containing 3 NWires', PlusConfiguration_File_fCal_1.2.xml) and it recorded and saved 6GB files without problems, both in debug and release mode builds.

Could you please test if you can reproduce the crash with this simulated image source?

OK, so it seems to be a problem specific to that PC. It would be great if you could test the same thing on another computer.

I would temporarily add lots of additional logs to find out where the issue actually occurs. If the crash is reliably reproducible then with this approach we can locate the error very quickly. If you can set up remote access to the computer I can do this when I get back from MICCAI on Oct 10.

Andras, yes -- I will do all of this and will follow up with you.

#### 2012-10-05, 14:14:13 - Andrey Fedorov
I was able to get to the location of crash in the debugger, but is is not helpful -- it is crashing in CapturingToolbox::Save(), QFileDialog::getSaveFileName(). This happens only for large number of frames, and does not happen all the time.

Looking at the trace, there are messages related to data acquisition from VideoBuffer after the Save() was invoked -- is this expected?

Also, the reported FPS is clearly wrong -- the actual number of recorded frames in the time acquisition is completed does not match the expected # of frames with the reported 'actual' FPS.

#### 2012-10-05, 15:19:27 - Andrey Fedorov
Correction: FPS issue seems to be present only in my Plus-1.6 build. With the current trunk version, FPS makes a lot more sense (~20, while in 1.6 it goes as high as 150, and the number of captured frames does not match the reported FPS).

#### 2012-10-05, 15:27:43 - Andrey Fedorov
And another clarification: I can reproduce bogus FPS in 1.7/trunk version as well, but only in Debug mode.

@lassoan: tried to run your packaged Plus-1.7 build on a VirtualBox Win7 64 bit (the only other 64 bit windows I have access to), and there is an error about missing SapClassBasic72.dll. Google doesn't help. What do I need to install to have this library?

I think this is a dependency of BK libraries. I will see if I can resolve it by installing BK prerequisites. Weren't they supposed to be packaged with other libs? And how do I point to them if I install BK prerequisites?

#### 2012-10-05, 16:37:21 - Csaba Pinter
There is no such file in the PLTools/BK directory, so maybe installing the prerequisites would help.

As a temporary solution, you can copy the file (provided you have it) to the Plus-bin/bin directory, as unlike Slicer (with the launcher), Plus copies every needed file in that folder. On the long run, if it turns out to be needed, we can add it to PLTools.


#### 2012-10-05, 17:19:25 - Andrey Fedorov
@lassoan: Andras, what version of Dalsa drivers should I use? There's 7.00 and 7.20 in PLTools. I see your compiled Plus probably uses 7.00, because this is the only place where I see SapClassBasic70.dll. My builds are using version 7.20.

#### 2012-10-05, 21:23:02 - Andras Lasso
Sorry guys I had to give 3 presentations today and just got back to my computer now. SapClassBasic72.dll is part of the DALSA Sapera installer package. When you run the installer copies the dlls into the Windows system directories, that's why I chose not to include in the Plus package (because then we could end up having slightly different copies of the dlls in different directories). I now added a comment to the Hardware setup page that this Sapera package has to be installed, but let me know if we should do more (more documentation, adding the dlls to the Plus package, etc.).

#### 2012-10-07, 22:37:41 - Andras Lasso
@fedorov: To understand the location and root cause of the crash a bit better it would be great if you could temporarily split the operations in CapturingToolbox::Save() to as many separate lines as possible and add a log message after each line.

It might be also possible that the QT save dialog crashes in certain conditions (when there is not enough memory and/or some network resources are not available, etc.), so we'll add another Save button that just saves the captured frames into a file with automatically generated filename, without showing the file popup (#613). This will also make the saving a single-click operation.

#### 2012-10-07, 23:13:49 - Andrey Fedorov
Andras, the specific line in CaptureToolbox is known -- it is crashing in QFileDialog::getSaveFileName().

It looks like the frame callbacks are still invoked while Save() is in progress. Is this expected? Could the issue be related to some concurrent access to the buffer or related data?

Also, I will be away Thu-Fri, but if you have something to test before, I can do that Mon-Wed. Since the issue is reproducible without BK, this is very easy to do now.

Andras, which version of Dalsa drivers should I use -- 7.0 or 7.20? I noticed your version was linked against 7.0.

#### 2012-10-07, 23:27:14 - Andras Lasso
The QFileDialog::getSaveFileName is a long line. Do you know where and what crashes exactly? You may need to split it into multiple lines to know for sure.

  fileName = QFileDialog::getSaveFileName(NULL, tr('Save captured tracked frames'),
    QString('%1/TrackedImageSequence_%2').arg(m_LastSaveLocation).arg(vtksys::SystemTools::GetCurrentDateTime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S').c_str()), filter);
  m_LastSaveLocation = fileName.mid(0, fileName.lastIndexOf('/')); 

Use the most recent DALSA Sapera version (7.20). It seems to be much better than the 7.0 version (where some dlls were duplicated and 32/64-bit mixed, etc.). The default Sapera version in PlusBuild is 7.20, but you can double-check what version you use in the DALSASAPERA_DIR variable in your PlusBuild CMake cache.

The frame callbacks are called always but when the recording is stopped they are just used for updating the display, they are not added to the recording buffer. Copying of the frames into the recording buffer and writing the recording buffer to file are both done on the main thread, so no concurrent update/writing can happen.

I strongly suspect that there is an error is related to the file name selection (either in the string processing for constructing the default filename or the in the dialogbox).

Ok, I will debug this tomorrow. Thanks!

#### 2012-10-08, 14:36:28 - Andrey Fedorov
Andras, I modified the code as follows, and the crash is still coming from getSaveFileName:

  QString filter = QString( tr( 'SequenceMetaFiles (*.mha *.mhd)' ) );
  QString fileName;
  QString dir = QString('/');
  fileName = QFileDialog::getSaveFileName(NULL, tr('Save captured tracked frames'), dir, filter);

## #598 Add multi-thread support for fCal to improve usability
When running an algorithm, the CPU is crushed, causing the UI to perform very poorly.

Protecting the main thread from CPU intensive tasks will allow fCal to respond very nicely even when heavy algorithms are being run.

#### 2012-09-17, 18:14:08 - Csaba Pinter
We discussed this some time ago, and this is why we use timers where we can.
The gain/labor ratio is not that high as most of the tasks can already be performed quite well in fCal. It's true that there are computaionally heavy algorithms that we run, but with the only exception of the temporal calibration (where we pop up a window notifying the user that they have to be patient), they finish reasonably quickly.
If more pressing reasons come along, we may have to consider this though.

#### 2012-09-17, 18:42:24 - Andras Lasso
I agree that this is not a priority. The main use case of fCal is calibration, so it should be just good enough for that purpose.

Slicer is intended to be used for prototyping clinical applications (with PlusServer running on the data acquisition computer), so the GUI will run not just in a different thread, but in a different process, most of the time on a different computer.

## #600 Add a button to reset tracker in fCal
The gyroscopes in accelerometer devices sometimes need manual reset. Add a 'Reset tracker' button in fCal to initialize this function instead of doing it automatically at Connect().

Specifically, for vtkPhidgetSpatialTracker the CPhidgetSpatial_zeroGyro(this->SpatialDeviceHandle) function should be called from vtkPhidgetSpatialTracker::Reset() instead of from vtkPhidgetSpatialTracker::Connect().
For now, no Reset method is needed for any other tracker.

Can be implemented for any system by overriding the IsResettable() and Reset() functions of any vtkPlusDevice

## #601 Cannot set default image saving directory in fCal
'Selection of the folder for storing dump files is not working -- it always uses the default directory. I tried to change 'Dump directory' (I think this is the name) where it saves debugging information, but it always used the default one in PlusBuild-bin/bin/Debug/Output, I think.'


#### 2012-09-17, 19:20:47 - Adam Rankin
In order to configure the output location, you may modify the image directory edit box in the configuration tab.

Note: this location is used for both input and output. If you are using a file sequence as input to fCal, you must have this location set to desired image directory.

During a single run, the Save functionality of the capturing tab will remember the last directory you saved to, and prompt you with that directory next time.

If possible, could you confirm that this is the way it's working for you, and if not, could you describe what is going wrong?

## #602 Change label if maximum recording frame rate is selected in fCal
'setting capture rate to 30 FPS appears to mean 'maximum possible FPS'. It might make sense to have separate 'max' position for the slider.'

Double-check if the highest settings indeed means 'maximum' FPS. If that's the case then display 'maximum' instead of a specific number.


#### 2012-09-17, 19:54:32 - Adam Rankin
More info:

5) Do you remember what FPS did you get when you selected the maximum option and what did you get if you moved the slider on step lower?

A: When I placed it to the right hand side limit, I think I was getting 50-70 fps. If I put it one step lower from the limit, I was getting consistently about 15 fps, as expected.



#### 2012-09-17, 20:00:26 - Adam Rankin
After checking it out, setting it to 30FPS did indeed limit it to 30 FPS. 

I did notice a 'surge' as processing caught up to video, but then it stabilized under 30 FPS.

Is there a situation where I can reproduce the higher sustained recording rate?

#### 2012-09-17, 20:44:59 - Andras Lasso
There may be a mismatch if the video source does not respect the requested frame rate. E.g., the actual rate of putting new frames into the recording buffer is higher than the AcquisitionRate set in the config file. This is the case for the BK video source, which records a frame whenever its callback function gets called with a new frame.

#### 2012-09-17, 20:47:06 - Andras Lasso
Andriy, could you please test what frame rate you get if you change the AcquisitionRate value in the config file to 60?
To get accurate estimations we may need to set this value so that it matches the actual acquisition rate (or get the frame rate value through the OEM interface).

assigned_to_id: changed from "rankin" to "fedorov"

#### 2012-09-27, 17:49:02 - Andrey Fedorov
If I change AcquisitionRate to 60 in xml, I have max sampling rate at 60 in fCal too.

But the actual sampling FPS goes all the way up to 100-280 after some time, and stays there (see screenshot).

The frame rate I am getting from OEM is ~17, but I do not know if this is the b-mode or RF frame rate, over OEM or over the camera link (documentation doesn't elaborate). If I measure frame rate of getting frames over OEM (ProFocus screencaptures), I am getting abut 3FPS.

I cannot consistently reproduce this issue with very large FPS. Tested again with prescribed AcquisitionRate 60. In the recording mode, up until ~800 captured frames actual FPS stayed ~19, after 800 quickly increased to ~37. When I stopped and tried to save -- crash. When it crashes, I am not prompted to debug, and the output log does not have any hints on what happened.

#### 2012-09-27, 18:16:49 - Andras Lasso
Are any errors logged near that time when the FPS jumps? Are any errors logged before the crash? If not, could you reproduce  the error and collect logs at debug level?
Is fCal built in debug mode? Started with the debugger?

It seems that the storing of the frames cannot keep up with the acquisition of new data.
* Try to increase the ImageAcquisition BufferSize (to a max of about 500)
* Try to lower the frame rate (to a min of about 10 fps)
* Set the debug level to INFO or DEBUG to reduce the time spent with printing log messages
* Try to decrease the CPU load by building the application in DEBUG mode and not running any other application in parallel

## #605 Teporal calibration wrong intensity compute
While temporal calibration, only several points from image sequence are being properly chosen. I suppose that the inscription on image's header influences on proper line. I attach scans to show, what I mean. 

Maybe possible solution would be to add a ROI on the image?

Probably the issue is what you suggest, and this is what we do in course of the spatial calibration.
I need to look into it more.

#### 2012-09-24, 16:52:57 - Andras Lasso
To reduce the amount of acquired data in general it would be useful to clip the ROI in the video source (as in the Epiphan video source). Actually, I need this right now for connecting to a Medison system using the ImagingControl framegrabber, so I'll implement this.

In addition to this low-level clipping, a ROI definition in the temporal calib algo can be useful, too. I will not implement this now.

Thanks for the proposed change of altering the image intensity values. Clipping the image is somewhat more generic and also reduces the amount of processed and transferred data, so I implemented that. If intensity value changing is needed then it can be added later on request.

## #606 fCal Phantom 3.0
Feel free to describe the motivation/reasons for creating the phantom.

Describe some of the structures of the phantom and why they were chosen.

Etc...

#### 2012-09-25, 15:50:28 - Adam Rankin
From Guillermo:

'I uploaded to the repository the 4 parts of the fCal 3.0 in separated .stl files.
They are in PlusLib/docs/fCal/CAD
fCal 3.0 consist in two main walls (front and back), a part in which you can put the sensors and others pats (unions)  that are used for assembling.
Please, look the files and let me know any sugestions, modification or change.'

#### 2012-09-25, 17:39:36 - GuillermoCarbajal
fCal 3.0 is made up of 4 parts:
* front and back wall:
     ** dimensions are 220 x 150 x 10 mm
     ** separation between holes is 5mm in the upper grid and 10 mm in the lower grid. The upper grid is for using with the linear probe and the lower grid is for the curvilinear probe (top grid can also be used with the curvilinear probe)
     ** all the holes are uniquely identified by a letter and a number
     ** holes design is similar to fCal 2.0
     ** both walls have 6 holes of 7mm diameter for assembling.
     ** separation between front and back walls is 4cm
* left wall
    **  It was designed to put sensors on it
    ** dimension 55mm x 30 mm x (4mm + 40mm + 4mm)
    ** holes for the sensors are similar to fCal 2.0
    ** It has a hole of 7mm diameter for assembling.
* unions 
   ** there are 5 unions. 
   ** dimension is (4mm + 40 mm + 4mm) x 40 mm x 20 mm 
    ** It has a hole of 7mm diameter for assembling.

The main idea behind the design is reduce the volume of the different parts in order to reduce the cost.

#### 2012-09-25, 17:55:38 - Csaba Pinter
Just some thoughts:

* The rectangular marker holder hole in the 'Left' part has a small circular hole that is essential if one wants to remove the marker and it's stuck. In the assembled model, that hole is obstructed, one cannot access it. As I think the idea is to glue the parts together, this would be an issue.
* The letters (and the numbers a bit as well) are confusing, because the column 'A' can mean two completely different spatial position. Would it be useful or possible to differenciate them somehow? Maybe with a prefix for the numbering and letters of one of the grids?
* Is the large grid for the probes with wide range of depth? If I want to image that grid, am I supposed to image it holding the probe on the side of lower or the higher numbers? In case the lower numbers, isn't the distance from the probe too far (we can't stick the probe in as the distance between the walls is 4cm)? If the higher, isn't it a problem that the marker connects to the other side?
* Will the fitting of the parts with the wedges accurate enough?

#### 2012-09-26, 09:03:38 - Andras Lasso
The assembly will be held together by screws, there will be no glue.

My understanding is that the probe will be always outside of the phantom (we may even fill the phantom with gel). The distance between the front/back planes may still be too small, but then we'll just print larger spacers.


#### 2012-09-26, 09:03:45 - Andras Lasso
Nice work Guillermo! A few suggestions:
* Move landmark point 3, 7, and 8 closer to the center of the part
* Make the numbering of the landmark points more straightforward. For example, a convenient order would be: 1, 4, 9, 2, 3, 10, 5, 8, 11, 6, 7, 12 (so, rename 4->2, 9->3, 2->4, etc.)
* Engrave labeling into every part: front: OK as is; back: add 'fCal 3.0'; spacer with sensor holder: add 'fCal 3.0 sensor block' (or 'fCal 3.0 sensor'); other spacers: add 'fCal 3.0 spacer block' (or 'fCal 3.0 spacer')
* Rename 'union' to 'spacer' everywhere (filename, documentation, ...)
* Put the 'Left' label on the side of the front or back part
* Q6 hole is missing

(In r:2133|plus:2133) Re #606: 
New version of fCal 3.0 with some modifications:
•  Circles were replaced by triangles. We think (Sue Sue, Tamas and me) that position of the wires is determined  with more precision in triangles than in circles. As in fCal 2.0 triangles were tilted 20 grades and edges were rounded for threading more easily.
•  Base of  triangles is 2mm and the height is also 2 mm.
•  Some registration holes were moved and renamed.
•   Dimension of sensor holder block was modified in order to get more space to put something in the lower hole just in case sensor getting stuck.  I think the space now is enough. 
•  Back, Spacer and sensor holder were labeled.
•  Nomenclature was changed.  Columns of the small grid  now are referenced with lowercase letters and columns of the big pattern are referenced with uppercase letters. In both walls (front and back) there is a hole called A1 for instance but you can distinguish between them with the prefix fA1 or bA1 (front A1 or back A1).
•  Upper wire holders were moved down and lower wire holders were moved in direction to the lateral sides. I think this will help when threading the wires.

Please, look at the new version (PlusLib\\docs\\fCAL\\CAD\\fCal3.0) and let me know your comments

#### 2012-09-26, 23:26:16 - Andras Lasso

## #607 Create a GUI to create/maintain Plus configuration files

#### 2012-10-01, 17:24:22 - Andras Lasso
Developing a convenient config file generator requires significant effort, but it's much more, continuous work to maintain it. It would mean that after any configuration related change the generator shall be also updated (and of course the example config files still have to be maintained the same way).

Instead of developing a generator wizard I would rather invest time in creating better documentation for the configuration file structure, potentially (partially) automatically generated.

#### 2012-10-02, 16:12:13 - Adam Rankin
I agree that it would require a non-trivial amount of effort.

I would argue though, that it would save all of us time (more than the time spent developing it) because we would see a reduced amount of complaints/tickets/emails regarding incorrect configuration files.

Essentially, it would create a more robust product. If we design it correctly, we could push an update to the template XML file, and a new configuration file can be generated. This would trivialize updates to the software for our end users.

#### 2012-10-02, 16:30:06 - Andras Lasso
I agree that such a tool would have some value to some people. Anyway, the cost/benefit ratio is quite high and we have much more pressing needs, so we have time to further discuss this and decide when to implement this.

#### 2012-10-02, 18:00:48 - Csaba Pinter
priority: changed from "High (2)" to "Normal (3)"

#### 2012-10-02, 18:03:55 - Csaba Pinter
It's not a priority now, but I think it would reduce user support needs.

It wouldn't be a big effort to implement, as we only have to expose the XSL template on a GUI. As long as we maintain the XSL, this tool would be up-to-date, so maintenance wouldn't be too burdensome either.

I think this tool will be worth to develop when we don't have very urgent tasks.

#### 2012-10-04, 14:17:08 - Andras Lasso
We can implement such tool sometime, but I think it's low priority (compared to other things that we have to do) because of the followings:

High cost:
* A few years ago no free tool existed that allowed creating/editing an XML file based on XSL. Do you know any that is available now?
* Everything can be solved with a custom editor app, but the development would take several weeks and the continuous maintenance would take even more of our time.

Small benefit:
* The XSL and editor can only prevent syntax errors. There are many constraints, logic, constraints, which cannot be encoded in XSL. So, we cannot prevent generation of invalid or dysfunctional config files.
* The users would need working examples and documentation of the configuration anyway. But if these existed then there would be little need for an editor.
* In the config files now it's easy to add comments, extra blocks that are used by a custom application only, etc. Probably this wouldn't be compatible with the editor, so we could end up being able to use the editor only for some toy examples and not for real work.

## #610 Plus tutorial using no special hardware
According to a former discussion with Tamas, it would significantly boost the currency of Plus, if we had a tutorial that can be done at home using no special hardware.

A possible approach is a MicronTracker-like home-made tracking system, consisting only of a webcam, and printed markers.

The biggest component we don't have is a (checkerboard) camera calibration algorithm, but there may be an open-source method we can integrate.

#### 2012-10-02, 15:37:40 - Tamas Ungi
If one wants to do a webcam tracker, IGSTK should be checked. They probably use OpenCV or something like that.
Unfortunately the biggest advantage of PLUS (ultrasound) is not so easy to try at home.

## #612 Add support for double tracking for vtkDataCollector


#### 2012-10-05, 00:18:21 - Siavash Khallaghi
Basically the idea is to read two trackers from the configuration file. On *DataCollector->Connect()*, both trackers should get connected to the hardware.
When *DataCollector->StartRecording()* is called, the frame container should read tracking information from both sources.
When *TrackedFrameList->WriteToMetaFile()* is called, the mha file should have two sets of transforms, i.e. *ProbeToTracker1*, *ReferenceToTracker1*, *ProbeToTracker2* and *ReferenceToTracker2*.

Basically, modifying a local version of DataCollector, let's call it *PatchedDataCollector*, so that it provides us with transform stamping in a crude way, until a definitive solution is available?

We can make twenty easy 'easy fixes' in this topic, but #461 solves everything at once, this one included. As validation of a tracker using another is a use case of that ticket (it is exactly what is described here), there is no need to this one.

Siavash, what is the May 9, 2012 date you mention?
If you need this feature sooner than a month, you can implement it.
Otherwise, this is invalid.

#### 2012-10-05, 00:52:44 - Siavash Khallaghi
The last comment on #461 was *'Probably Csaba will work on that after May 9. Need to provide a solution for #476 as well.'* So that is why I assumed #461 will not get resolved until May 9.

We (Samira and I) need it before October 14, so basically we need to find a temporary solution for this. Samira and I will talk about this probably tomorrow, but in the mean while, I would appreciate your feedback.

Maybe it is not a bad idea to continue discussion on this thread instead of #461, since this is just a temporary solution.

Ah welcome to the wierdness that is Assembla's layout. The comment order is top to bottom = oldest to newest BUT page 1 is latest, page 2 is older...

Unfortunately I am fully commited to the multi stream implementation. It will address your issue but it will be approximately 1 to 2 months. If this is urgent, I suggest you talk to Andras Lasso (I will add him to this ticket).

#### 2012-10-05, 01:36:44 - Csaba Pinter
May 9 2012 _was_ 5 months ago. We slipped with our plans, this is why Adam is working on it now.

If you asked me, I would say if you need this so fast, implement it yourselves, because it doesn't make sense for us to work on a temporary solution in the middle of working on the permanent solution. If you agree, assign this issue to yourself.

#### 2012-10-05, 01:50:41 - Tamas Ungi
Matthew Holden used two computers as a temporary solution over the summer. He had to synchronize the two recordings later using a characteristic motion pattern in the beginning of the recording. Two PLUS instances were running at the same time on the two computers.

#### 2012-10-05, 01:55:42 - Csaba Pinter
Actually what Tamas says could work for you until we provide the safe and permanent solution.
This way you don't have to engage in serious programming for the sake of a temporary development, which would be thrown away later.

#### 2012-10-05, 02:09:56 - Tamas Ungi
I'm sure Matthew will share every detail with you on request. I think he used Matlab for offline synchronization. If this system setup could work for you at all.

#### 2012-10-05, 15:05:14 - Adam Rankin
Siavash,

If you want to program a temporary solution, could you create a branch/user sandbox of the trunk and do development in there?

#### 2012-10-05, 20:59:28 - Siavash Khallaghi
Of course. This was actually my plan.

#### 2012-10-05, 22:23:28 - Andras Lasso
I would recommend to use the TemporalCalibration algorithm class to synchronize the two tracker streams. It should be just generalized a bit: instead of SetTrackerFrames(vtkTrackedFrameList* trackerFrames) and SetVideoFrames(vtkTrackedFrameList* videoFrames) the methods should be SetReferenceFrames(vtkTrackedFrameList* trackerFrames, PositionMetricType metricType) and SetDelayedFrames(vtkTrackedFrameList* trackerFrames, PositionMetricType metricType), where enum PositionMetricType { METRIC_POSITION, METRIC_IMAGE }. Then, depending on the metricType, ComputeTrackerPositionMetric or ComputeVideoPositionMetric should be called. This change should be done after @EricMoult has merged his latest improvements in the temporal calibration algorithm.

## #613 Add save button to capture toolbox
Currently the capture toolbox only have a 'Save as...' button, which always require specification of a filename. Although a new name is automatically generated for the file and it's enough to just click enter, but it's still an extra click and when there is not enough memory or when there are network issues then the file save dialog may not appear or may take long time to appear (it might even crash the application, but this is not confirmed, see #596).

Suggested implementation:
* have a 'Save as...' button that does exactly the same as the current 'Save...' button. 
* have a 'Save' button, that just saves the buffer with the default filename without asking anything (optionally, near this save button there could be a textbox, maybe an editbox that shows the directory and the base filename)

#### 2012-10-07, 22:29:13 - Andras Lasso
Adam, it would be great if you could implement this till Wednesday (Andriy will not be available this week after Wednesday). It would allow Andriy to test if the fCal crash during save is related to the file dialog.

Thanks for the quick implementation Adam, it works well. Two small things would be needed to make the GUI more obvious to use:
* Give some feedback about where the file is saved (and that the save was successful), e.g., write something like this in a textbox below the button 'Saving completed to file C:/fullpath/filename.mha' (clear this textbox when new frames acquired that are not saved yet)
* Remove the '...' from the Save button label (as the user is not prompted for additional data) 

#### 2012-10-09, 19:03:20 - Andras Lasso
@fedorov: Could you please test if you can reproduce the saving issue in #596 if the simple Save button is used (when the file dialog is not invoked)?

#### 2012-10-09, 19:05:13 - Csaba Pinter
@rankin: I think such a messagebox is shown in SegmentationParameterDialog when saving the frozen image. You can use that (to save time)

#### 2012-10-09, 19:13:50 - Andras Lasso
I would prefer having a message display method that does not require any extra clicks or mouse moves to acknowledge. Popups are OK for exceptional cases or rarely used functions, but not ideal for such regular informational message. Adding 1 extra mouse move and 1 extra click to the currently needed 3 clicks and 2 moves would be 50% and 33% increase without any added value.

#### 2012-10-09, 19:17:17 - Csaba Pinter
Do you want me to change that messagebox in SegmentationParameterDialog too?

#### 2012-10-09, 19:19:13 - Andras Lasso
That's OK, as it is not used frequently and it would not be trivial to find a place for a non-intrusive message on the GUI and a criteria to hide the message (timeout? button press? new image received?).

## #614 Revise the new Sikuli capabilities and switch to QtTesting framework if needed
Note: Sikuli has been revived (got some funding and new owners), so before ditching it, we should wait for a release and try it.

We need to find a substitute for Sikuli for automated GUI testing, and QtTesting seems to be the best candidate (Slicer community also uses this one).

Tests need to be created for the same tasks that we cover with Sikuli at the moment.
If QtTesting proves to be a good solution for the automated tests, we can remove the Sikuli tests once we have the QtTesting variant.

Edit: QtTesting is a viable candidate as demonstrated by the url:https://github.com/IGSIO/OpenIGTLinkIO|IGSIO/OpenIGTLinkIO project!

## #616 Save volume reconstruction output to different file formats
Unfortunately image orientation in mha is not read correctly by ITK v3. This will stay a problem in many programs, including Slicer for a long time. We need to choose another file format (e.g. nrrd), or come up with a workaround to be able to use reconstructed images in IGT (and other) applications.

#### 2012-10-16, 22:26:48 - Andras Lasso
There are two problems with the mha file reading in Slicer, see http://www.na-mic.org/Bug/view.php?id=2173.

We can make these errors asymptomatic if we save the images in LPS orientation.


#### 2012-10-17, 02:28:03 - Andras Lasso
Fixed saving of reconstructed volumes. Now when the reconstructed volume is loaded into Slicer it appears in the correct position. The problem was that the origin was not saved into the header. Also, the anatomical image orientation was set to LPS to match the assumption of Slicer (that ignores the anatomical image orientation attribute and always assumes LPS orientation).

## #617 Save as dialog box can cause random crash on certain computers
When displaying the 'Save as' dialog box when trying to save a captured sequence in fCal randomly causes crash on a computer. If the popup is not displayed (and a preset file name is used instead) then there is no crash.

The crash is coming from getSaveFileName:
QString filter = QString( tr( 'SequenceMetaFiles (*.mha *.mhd)' ) );
QString fileName;
QString dir = QString('/');
fileName = QFileDialog::getSaveFileName(NULL, tr('Save captured tracked frames'), dir, filter);

Maybe upgrade to a more recent QT version could resolve the issue. We use the same QT version as the current 3D Slicer, so do the upgrade when the QT upgrade is done in Slicer.

I've run temporal calibration on the 20 baseline sequences. If I used all the frames then there were still a few inaccurate calibrations (e.g., Trial13). After I cut an 2sec at the beginning and end of each data set then I could reproduce very similar results as we had earlier ([-0.057 -0.06 -0.058 -0.065 -0.061 -0.059 -0.066 -0.059 -0.057 -0.059 -0.056 -0.061 -0.06 -0.062 -0.06 -0.062 -0.058 -0.053 -0.053 -0.058], mean=-0.059, stdev=0.003).

A standard deviation of 3msec is quite good, as it means that in 99% of the cases the time shift error is under 10msec. With a speed of 1cm/sec it means 0.1mm error, which should be acceptable (although there is rotational motion, which may cause larger dislocation at a large image depth; and need more data to confirm that the distribution is normal, now the 3sigma = 99% is just an assumption).

(In r:2793|plus:2793) re #618: Two changes: 

(1) I changed from using amplitude normalization to std normalization. This change was made because it seems that normalization by std is more robust than by amplitude (based on our collected US sequences). As a result normalization by std produces lower variances in time-offset between trials (for fixed imaging parameters; again, based on our collected US sequences).

(2) I changed the max time-offset from 2 s to 0.5 s. Note that the 0.5 s max-time offset is desirable because (a) the time-offsets are all under 0.5 s (and thus within the +/-0.5 s range created by a max-time offset of 0.5 s) and (b) the +/-0.5 s range allows for a period of probe motion that is as low as 1 s. On the other hand, with a 2 sec max time-offset, we must assume that the period of probe motion is greater than 4 s(which it often isn't). Note that if the period of probe motion is less than 2 times the max time-offset and the signal is (perfectly/ nearly) periodic, there is a risk that the sliding signal is shifted over by a period during the alignment process (i.e. the computed time-offset will be: true time-offset + 1 period of probe motion). I changed the max time-offset for 2 s to 0.5 s both in the TemporalCalibrationAlgoTest.cxx file and as the default in the TemporalCalibrationAlgo.cxx file.

## #621 Image orientation arrows in fCal are incorrectly displayed for RF data
Connect to the 'RF data collection' device set (in ConfigFiles/Testing). Go to the Capturing tab.
The M arrow points to the right and the F arrow points down => this is wrong. M and F are mixed up.

Note that B-mode data is always stored in MF orientation in Plus, while RF-mode (non-scan-converted) data is always stored in FM orientation (see Ultrasound_image_orientation).

Also note that if RF processing parameters are defined in the config file then fCal can convert the acquired RF-mode images to B-mode images for display. If the images are converted to B-mode then they are displayed as B-mode and so the arrows should be displayed as usual for B-mode images (M/U direction horizontal; F/N direction is vertical).

Currently, in the 'RF data collection' the scan conversion is not performed because the TransducerGeometry='CURVILINEAR' attribute is missing from the ScanConversion element. This missing attribute should be added to the config file.

#### 2013-04-08, 01:24:35 - Andras Lasso
Added a sample config file: PlusConfiguration_DataCollectionOnly_SavedDatasetRf.xml.

I may have written earlier that when no RF processing params are available then there is no need to display anything, but actually showing the raw (only brightness converted) RF data is a necessary feature. So, when no RF processing parameters are specified then we should do one of these:
* A. Display RF data with default RF processing parameters (brightness conversion with default parameters, no scan conversion). Although not much visible from this RF data, what is visible is very important because it can be used to verify the correct orientation of the image (when one side of the transducer surface is touched then changes are visible in the corresponding side of the raw RF image so the user can check if the correct side was touched).
* B. Log a meaningful error message, explaining that image is not displayed because RF processing params are not available (so that the user can fix the issue). Currently this message floods the log: VTK log: ERROR: In ..\\..\\vtk\\Filtering\\vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx, line 727|vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline (09D621D8): Input port 0 of alg

The problem was that the server tried to send all the frames since the last client connection, but those were not available in the buffers anymore (because there could be a long time between the last clients disconnect and a new client connect).

Thanks for reporting this, we'll investigate this problem soon.

In general, if the imaging parameters are set correctly and so there are not too many and points that look like fiducial points then there should be no slowdowns.

The current implementation fails to detect fiducials if there are too many point candidates. The correct operation would be to just use the N highest-ranked fiducial candidates for the rest of the calibration process.

Specifically, FidPatternRecognition::RecognizePattern(TrackedFrame* trackedFrame, PatternRecognitionError& patternRecognitionError) should not return with an error if( m_FidSegmentation.GetDotsVector().size() > m_MaxNumberOfCandidates ) but simply ignore all the fiducial candidates over the maximum number and return with a warning.

The maximum number of fiducial candidates should be passed to m_FidSegmentation object (to limit the number of returned maximum fiducial candidate count) or to the m_FidLineFinder object (that would ignore all the candidates over the maximum count) instead of used in FidPatternRecognition.

We should set a good default value for the MaxCandidates value that works well for most of the cases and not too big to cause inconvenient delays (maybe 20?). Add the MaxCandidates value to the XML file only if it differs from the default value to make the config files simpler (and the default value easier to modify).

Change the MaxCandidates name to NumberOfMaximumFiducialPointCandidates everywhere (XML attribute name, member variable name).

A few other findings in these classes:
* m_CandidateFidValues objects could be probably removed
* passing vector by value is inefficient:
** FidLineFinder::SetCandidateFidValues(std::vector<Dot> value) 
** FidLineFinder::SetDotsVector(std::vector<Dot> value)
** std::vector<std::vector<Line> >  FidLineFinder::GetLinesVector()
** std::vector<Pattern*> GetPatterns()
** std::vector<NWire> GetNWires()


#### 2012-11-28, 00:17:54 - Csaba Pinter
Good points!

One thing that came to mind: if the maximum candidates number is lower than the number of wires, then log a warning or error.

#### 2012-11-29, 20:13:41 - Adam Rankin
(In r:2290|plus:2290) Re #625

Removing max number of candidates from configuration files except where automated tests require augmented values. Value will be written if it differs from DEFAULT_NUMBER_OF_MAXIMUM_FIDUCIAL_POINT_CANDIDATES.

## #631 Make vtkOpenIGTLinkTracker compatible with TDATA messages
Brainlab sens TDATA message type through OpenIGTLink:
http://www.na-mic.org/Wiki/index.php/OpenIGTLink/ProtocolV2/Type/TrackingData


#### 2012-12-07, 04:07:54 - Tamas Ungi
(In r:2303|plus:2303) Re #631: WIP. TDATA messages are received. But for some reason a test with PlusServer cannot send TRANSFORM messages, so the tracking data is probably not usable yet.

#### 2012-12-07, 04:30:53 - Tamas Ungi
When trying to debug the PlusServer, I put a breakpoint at vtkPlusOpenIGTLinkServer.cxx:304
The program strangely stops there occasionally and then TRANSFORM messages are sent to Slicer.
But when I remove the breakpoint, messages are not sent to Slicer. So the problem must be related to some real-time buffering feature.

#### 2012-12-07, 04:41:02 - Tamas Ungi
When I manage to stop vtkPlusOpenIGTLinkServer::DataSenderThread with a debug breakpoint, then remove the breakpoint and let the program go, PlusServer is working for about 10 seconds. Then it stops working again... it needs to be debugged further.

## #633 3dConnexion tracker not working
I have compiled PLUS in 64-bit. I didn't find any configuration option to add the 3dConnexion tracker, so I expected it to work. I get the following error when I try to use it with the config file from the PlusApp installer package:

## #634 fCal crash during data recording
I compiled PLUS in 64-bit. Then started fCal to record data using Epiphan video and OpenIGTLinkTracker. Short data recording sessions went well. When I left the recording for longer time, fCal crashed after 1898 frames.

Update after more testing: I repeated this test on the same hardware with the same config file, and couldn't reproduce the problem. I could fill my available computer memory (over 3 GB) by recording tracked frames with fCal, and no errors happened.

#### 2012-12-09, 04:00:06 - Csaba Pinter
Strange. We should repeat this test several times in debug mode with the process attached to the debugger.
(My guess is that this crash has already been there in the 1.x versions before the multistream merge)

fCal reproducibly crashes even without any data recording, just if it stays connected for about 10-20 minutes. Happens in both debug and release mode. Not due to memory leaks.

The problem seems to be related to passing around vtkSmartPointer<vtkPlusStreamBuffer>, see attached screenshots.

Maybe the root cause of the problem is the lack of vtkPlusStreamBuffer::operator=.

Or, maybe there is an issue with reference counting with vtkSmartPointer simultaneously in multiple threads? Even if it's not the root cause of the crash, the current way of iterating through the frame buffer is quite expensive, as the StreamBuffer seems to get copied and deleted in each iteration: for( StreamBufferMapContainerConstIterator bufIt = stream->GetBuffersStartConstIterator(); bufIt != stream->GetBuffersEndConstIterator(); ++bufIt) { vtkSmartPointer<vtkPlusStreamBuffer> buffer = bufIt->second; ...}. I would consider storing just pointers (instead of smart pointers) in an STL container, or storing the VTK objects in a VTK container (e.g., vtkCollection, which manages reference counting properly, without copying the object each time it is accessed).

I think Isaiah ran some longer recording sessions yesterday. He didn't report any crash during that, so it's probably fixed.

re #634 Using thread safe function mktemp to generate temp filename instead of tmpnam

Commit: r:4344|plus:4344


## #635 Create application that combines PlusServer and data recording
Many applications use Slicer as GUI, and use PLUS through the PlusServer. To be able to record lossless data (Slicer may not process the full bandwidth), data recording should be implemented on the PLUS side (as the capturing function in fCal).
I can think of two options:
1. Add PlusOpenIGTLinkServer to fCal. The server is just a class, and doesn't require additional GUI. So this is not much work. Slicer could run parallel with fCal and display the data that is being recorded by fCal.
2. Add data recording option to PlusServer. This would require implementation of 'start rec / stop rec' command messages in PlusServer, or a PlusServer GUI.

The second option would probably be a better design on the long run. But this is an important feature, so implementing the first until the second is ready would be appreciated too.

Commands can now be sent to PlusServer through OpenIGTLink (GET_REXEC, STRING type) and PlusServer replies after execution (RTS_REXEC, STATUS type). Custom commands can be registered at the vtkPlusCommandProcessor. Command names and parameters are encoded in XML: <Command Name='SomeCommand' SomeParam='35' SomeOtherParam='46' />. Replies can be any custom string. See the PlusServerRemoteControl application for a simple example. The two existing commands (start and stop data collector) just print a message in the server - real working commands will be added later (start recording, stop recording, save to file, volume reconstruction, etc.).

## #636 Merge all recent changes into the trunk
During the multi-stream branch merge into the trunk (commit 2318) some recent developments have been skipped:
* vtkBkProFocusVideoSource (commit 2223)
* Linux build errors (https://www.assembla.com/spaces/plus/messages/2548853)

Until the trunk is fixed the latest stable branch (https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/plus/branches/Plus-1.8).

I fixed the build errors in the weekend in 2312 and asked Adam to clean it up. He said he was going to do it today.

#### 2012-12-11, 15:30:59 - Andras Lasso
I've reviewed all the files one-by-one in the 2318 commit and found the followings:

Some developments have been not merged:
* vtkBkProFocusVideoSource.cxx
* vtkPhidgetSpatialTracker.cxx,h
* vtkSonixVideoSource.cxx
* vtkUsSimulatorVideoSource.cxx (WriteConfiguration is missing)

Questions and minor comments:
* Why this->SpawnThreadForRecording has been removed (vtkEpiphanVideoSource.cxx, vtkOpenIGTLinkVideoSource.cxx, ...)? Is a thread always created? Thread is probably not needed if a callback function is used.
* vtkNDICertusTracker.cxx => Why the no threading version has been removed in PlusStatus vtkNDICertusTracker::StartTracking()?
* Clarify the role of vtkPlusDevice::IsTracker(). The current comment (Answer the question: are you a tracker?) is not helpful. What happens if the device provides both video and tracking data?
* Remove the 'AR:' from comments (// AR: update the number of frames.)
* int frameSize[2]; => always initialize to {0,0}
* Why the AddDefaultBuffer(aBuffer, 0); calls are needed? Couldn't we add a default buffer by default?
* vtkPlusStreamBuffer::vtkPlusStreamBuffer() => Initialize the buffer size to 500 might be a bit too large for video devices

Also, please review all the commits between 2299 and 2314 to make sure that everything is included in the latest trunk version (e.g., the linux build error is there because the fix was done in 2312 and it was not included in the latest trunk).

_vtkUsSimulatorVideoSource.cxx (WriteConfiguration is missing)_
The write configuration did nothing but call the superclass::writeconfiguration. Write configuration is now virtual so it will have the same behaviour.

_Why this->SpawnThreadForRecording has been removed (vtkEpiphanVideoSource.cxx, vtkOpenIGTLinkVideoSource.cxx, ...)? Is a thread always created? Thread is probably not needed if a callback function is used._
Architecture simplicity. The small overhead of having a thread for the cleanliness of the architecture was considered a positive step.

_vtkNDICertusTracker.cxx => Why the no threading version has been removed in PlusStatus vtkNDICertusTracker::StartTracking()?_
Merge loss. Fixed. But overriding the architecture seems like a hack. Does the NDI Certus only work if no threading is specified?

_Clarify the role of vtkPlusDevice::IsTracker(). The current comment (Answer the question: are you a tracker?) is not helpful. What happens if the device provides both video and tracking data?_
Function removed. Legacy code from a first attempt.

_Remove the 'AR:' from comments (// AR: update the number of frames.)_
Those are not comments from me. Still remove?

_int frameSize[2]; => always initialize to {0,0}_
Done.

_Why the AddDefaultBuffer(aBuffer, 0); calls are needed? Couldn't we add a default buffer by default?_
These functions were added for the automated tests that create devices directly. I could rename them to be more indicative that they shouldn't be used? Alternatively I could create configuration files for the automatic tests that don't have them and remove these functions.

_vtkPlusStreamBuffer::vtkPlusStreamBuffer() => Initialize the buffer size to 500 might be a bit too large for video devices_
Done.

It was a placeholder, to be completed later, but never mind. There should have been a comment there. In general it's good that code that doesn't do anything is removed.

>> Why this->SpawnThreadForRecording has been removed (vtkEpiphanVideoSource.cxx, vtkOpenIGTLinkVideoSource.cxx, ...)? Is a thread always created? Thread is probably not needed if a callback function is used.
> Architecture simplicity. The small overhead of having a thread for the cleanliness of the architecture was considered a positive step.

There are quite a lot of things are going on in vtkPlusDevice::vtkDataCaptureThread. The overhead may be negligible, but there is some interference with the real data capturing: self->InternalUpdateRate is computed while it should be computed from the actual callback rate; UpdateTime modified is called even if no update has been performed. So, some mechanism is required for disabling at least some of the operations in the data capture thread. The simplest may be to not even start the thread.

> Remove the 'AR:' from comments (// AR: update the number of frames.)

I have no idea who put the 'AR:' in the comments. Maybe they were intended for you to review? Anyway, after you've reviewed them they can be removed (either just the AR or the whole comment).

> Why the AddDefaultBuffer(aBuffer, 0); calls are needed? Couldn't we add a default buffer by default?

The best would be to avoid these calls entirely. If no buffer is defined in the config file or by the developer then the device should create its own default buffer (maybe in the Connect() method).

## #637 Use different postprocessing on acquired US images to improve image quality
This may be an idea for a student project in the future.

Stephen Aylward suggested that we look into this toolkit:
http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~rwp/stradx/
If it's not open-source now, Kitware can share their similar code if we want to integrate it into PLUS. It does homogeneity correction and/or corrects displacements due to varying pressure of the US probe on the tissue during scanning.

He also suggested to look into Danielle's work:
http://www.midasjournal.org/browse/publication/655
to see if we can harvest code/ideas.

#### 2012-12-12, 04:39:59 - Andras Lasso
StradX is not open-source. It would be interesting to know a bit more about what Kitware could contribute for the homogeneity/displacement correction.

We started from the Synchrograb4D version (Danielle's addition to Synchrograb), however the 4D add-on was removed due to increased complexity. With the multi-stream design it'll be easy to reintroduce 4D reconstruction (volume reconstruction of different heart phases) by adding a virtual splitter device.

Symmetric to <Tool> tag except that it's used to represent image buffers. Currently devices write to Device.Images[0] but future devices can do smart lookup of image buffers by ID.

Added clear option to fCal message log context menu

Removed notion of selectable devices, all devices shown to clients that request the list.

Thanks for the patch. Which Plus branch you would like this to be merged (1.6, 1.8, 2.0)?

If you need it in 1.6 or 1.8 then we'll have to change the patch slightly to keep supporting the SerialNumber attribute as well (for backward compatibility).

#### 2013-01-03, 15:36:59 - Isaiah Norton
I am using 2.0 so that will be fine for me. The existing SerialNumber field will work if anyone wants to use the Epiphan networked grabbers with older versions. I suggest this change just because it's non-obvious that the parameter can be used more generically without going through both sets of code.

I can add a small documentation note to the Hardware Setup page if that is the appropriate place (and maybe a link to this ticket)

#### 2013-01-04, 05:02:43 - Andras Lasso
The changes should be OK for 2.0. I've changed your membership status, so you can commit these changes yourself.

Hardware-specific config file options are described on the Hardware_setup page. It would be be useful to add a note there about how to specify serial number or network address for Epiphan framegrabbers (maybe just add some examples and refer to the SDK for details).

Thank you!

## #640 PlusServer 2.x crash
Generated package today: PlusApp_2.0.0.2347.zip
I tried this command: PlusServer --config-file=RefRASCalibration_Plus2.xml --verbose=5
(See config file attached.)
After a few seconds the VisualStudio debug window popped up saying that there is problem with PlusServer. I clicked NO (I didn't want to debug.)
After this, I couldn't interact with the command line window, I couldn't kill PlusServer application or process using Task Manager. I couldn't log out or shut down the OS either. I had to unpower Sonix Touch.
I tried it three times, same behavior every time.

## #641 Create tool to anonymize US data
A simple command line tool would be required that deletes the image from every frame inside a given rectangular region. With this tool, we could delete the patient name from recorded sequences. Recording in a given region is not a good solution because sometimes there is valuable image data in the same row and column as the patient name. So we need to delete a specific rectangle from the image (fill with black pixels) off-line.

Maybe just an additional command-line option could be added to the EditSeqMetaFile application, or a separate anonymizer application could be created in PlusApp.

You can scrub any number of regions by repeated calls of EditSeqMetafile (no lossy compression is performed, so repeated call doesn't have any side effect).
Would this solution work for you?

#### 2013-02-05, 22:43:43 - Isaiah Norton
The timestamp in the actual image can be handled with just one cropping region. 

What I meant is the timestamps saved with the data. However, on looking deeper I see that this is not a full date, so not necessary to scrub (date of procedure is restricted under privacy rules). As far as I can tell, the only real date in the PLUS mha & xml files is in the filename.

This is a problem for BrainLab in particular because some tools may not be in field at all times - for various reasons, including: line of sight obstruction, and because the stylus may be intentionally hidden by the surgeon in order to drive reslice planes from another tool (stylus is default driver)

#### 2013-01-10, 00:36:31 - Andras Lasso
Do you know if this problem is reproducible without having access to a BrainLab tracker (maybe with one of the OpenIGTLink examples)?

#### 2013-01-10, 00:39:59 - Isaiah Norton
It should be but I have not tried yet (I will add more information as soon as possible).. I think it would be demonstrated by setting the OpenIGTLink TDATA example to delay sending one of the matrices for 5s at the beginning of the connection.

#### 2013-01-10, 15:25:55 - Andras Lasso
(In r:2360|plus:2360) test #643: Potential fix for the BrainLab tracker tool initialization problem. The vtkOpenIGTLinkTracker now assumes that all the tools that are missing from TDATA messages are out of view (previously there were no data recorded in the buffer for these missing tools, which may have led to unexpected behaviour). Also added a BrainLab tracker simulator (BrainLabTrackerSim) to allow doing simple tests without having access to real hardware.

Something else is wrong my configuration or with the OpenIGTLink TDATA interface right now, but I think this particular issue is mostly fixed. 

One minor thing though: there is apparently a small delay before the system starts to stream coordinates (after STT_TDATA message). This message shows up once in the attached fCal log:

 '|ERROR|036.216000| Couldn't receive data from OpenIGTLink tracker|in ..\\..\\..\\PlusLib\\src\\DataCollection\\OpenIGTLinkTracking\\vtkOpenIGTLinkTracker.cxx(274)'

I added Sleep at the end of vtkOpenIGTLinkTracker::InternalConnect: the delay is between 75-100 ms (error at 75, no error at 100).

So this is a simple way to make the error above go away... is that appropriate, or something else?

There is also an opposite issue that vtkPlusDevice is very unhappy when there is any tool sent by OpenIGTLink that is *not* in the config file:

|ERROR|320.400000| Unable to find tool 'InstrumentM' in the list, please check the configuration file first.|in ..\\..\\..\\PlusLib\\src\\DataCollection\\vtkPlusDevice.cxx(300)

This is also a very typical situation (I don't want to change the config file during a case, but the surgeon might decide to use some extra tool). Not a problem to have that message, but perhaps worth considering.

#### 2013-02-04, 21:32:22 - Andras Lasso
Thanks for reporting the 'Couldn't receive data from OpenIGTLink tracker' error at startup. The delay in vtkOpenIGTLinkTracker::InternalConnect is just a specific solution. I've added a ticket to implement a long-term solution, see #666.

#### 2013-02-04, 21:35:38 - Andras Lasso
vtkPlusDevice is very unhappy when there is any tool sent by OpenIGTLink that is not in the config file => Probably the best solution is to report the the unexpected tool once (as an INFO or WARNING) when it first appears.

For the original issue, if the stream for TrackerInternalCoordinateSystemName (='ReferenceStar' here) is not available when the connection is initialized then tracking will be disabled for the duration of connection (even if the ReferenceStar comes back into view)

#### 2013-11-26, 19:36:10 - Adam Rankin
(In r:2999|plus:2999) test #643 Changing the approach to logging unknown or missing tools.

Optional device tag configuration option 'ReportUnknownToolsOnce=TRUE/FALSE' enables a singular report of a missing unknown tool.

Also changed the handling of missing tools in the openIGT link tracker to be less severe.

These changes combined should enable more graceful handling of the B rainLab tracking system.

This combined with the resolved re #666 should give the user enough control to successfully connect and receive data.

#666 will have no effect on the startup delay. The openIGTLink tracker is a threaded device and will ignore the StartupDelaySec.

I will implement a delay in the openigtlink tracker specifically

## #646 PLUS Compilation issue on Mac OSX 10.8
I tried to compile PLUS on Mac OSX 10.8, but I found out 2 issues:

- in PLUS-build/PlusLib/src/PlusCommon/vtkMetaImageSequenceIO.h (line 156) off64_t doesn't exist. Instead off_t was suggested.
I replaced off64_t by off_t and it worked.

Here is the code:
#ifdef _WIN32
  typedef __int64 FilePositionOffsetType;
#else
  typedef off_t FilePositionOffsetType;
#endif  

Maybe it should be modified by

#ifdef _WIN32
  typedef __int64 FilePositionOffsetType;
#elif defined __APPLE__
  typedef off_t FilePositionOffsetType;
#else
  typedef off64_t FilePositionOffsetType;
#endif  

This worked for me.

- The second issue is when compiling PlusApp, I got this error (linking):

#### 2013-01-10, 20:56:16 - Andras Lasso
For the QT linking problem: Plus uses the same QT version as Slicer (QT-4.7.4). It may work with other QT versions, but it's not tested. Have you tried to build Plus with QT-4.7.4?

If after the previous commit (2363) you don't get the following errors anymore, then it means that you use a non-supported QT version:
QString::ascii() const in ConfigurationToolbox.cxx.o
QString::ascii() const in CapturingToolbox.cxx.o

You can either use QT-4.7.4 or fix the QT API changes related code parts (probably minor differences in how to convert between Qstrings and plain char pointers)

#### 2013-01-10, 21:10:26 - Laurent Chauvin
I'm using Qt 4.7.4 from Slicer.

I think std::string filePath = aFilename.toAscii(); should be replace by std::string filePath = aFilename.toStdString(); otherwise I still got error about conversion from QByteArray to string.

But still I have this linking issue:

              toStdString() is not quite reliable. JC      suggested using toLatin1() instead. Could you try that?

#### 2013-01-10, 21:16:47 - Laurent Chauvin
I had to modifiy like this to use toLatin1:

std::string filePath(aFilename.toLatin1().data());

#### 2013-01-10, 21:26:58 - Laurent Chauvin
I'm actually surprised it compiles on other platform too because here is the code in fCalMainWindow.cxx in CreateToolboxes() function:
QGridLayout* grid = new QGridLayout(ui.toolbox_Configuration, 1, 1, 0, 0, '');

And the only constructor for QGridLayout I could find in Qt documentation is with this prototype:
QGridLayout ( QWidget * parent )

I think that's why it cannot link, because constructor prototype is different.

#### 2013-01-10, 21:36:46 - Laurent Chauvin
Does that mean I should disable QT3_SUPPORT ?

#### 2013-01-10, 21:39:04 - Csaba Pinter
              I think it means that Qt3 support is      needed for this constructor to work.
      Probably it would be a good idea to replace this constructor with      the Qt4 way.

#### 2013-01-10, 21:48:17 - Laurent Chauvin
It is possible to turn off QT3_SUPPORT ? I couldn't find it in the ccmake options.

Could you please send the build log when trying to build the latest version?

To fix the remaining errors we need to find out which lines cause them. Normally these kind of errors should be captured by the compiler, and the compiler would provide exact line numbers. But something may be wrong with your QT config (headers don't match exactly the libraries), so we have to figure out the line numbers by removing the code in the method bodies one-by-one and recompile after each and see when the error disappears.

Don't worry,  'No relevant class found' is a very common, innocent Qt warning. That doesn't mean any problem.

Please remove/comment method bodies in ConfigFileSaverDialog.cxx to find out the offending line (that as an implicit conversion to const char*) or check why your Qt headers don't match the linked Qt libraries.

It seems in ConfigFileSaveDialog.cxx, this is this line that create an issue:

deviceSet->SetAttribute('Name', ui.lineEdit_DeviceSetName->text()); (in SaveClicked method).

I think it's because of the 'text' method. Can it be replaced by something else ?
text() seems to return a ascii_helper if QT3_SUPPORT is turned on.

#### 2013-02-05, 20:02:49 - Laurent Chauvin
And the other is coming from VolumeReconstructionToolbox.cxx:393 
  if (trackedFrameList->ReadFromSequenceMetafile( m_ImageFileNames.at( imageFileNameIndex ) ) != PLUS_SUCCESS)

It seems to come from the method 'ReadFromSequenceMetafile'.

#### 2013-02-05, 20:24:27 - Laurent Chauvin
in ConfigFileSaveDialog.cxx, changing these lines (149-150):

deviceSet->SetAttribute('Name', ui.lineEdit_DeviceSetName->text());
deviceSet->SetAttribute('Description', ui.textEdit_Description->toPlainText());

by 


deviceSet->SetAttribute('Name', ui.lineEdit_DeviceSetName->text().toLatin1());
deviceSet->SetAttribute('Description', ui.textEdit_Description->toPlainText().toLatin1());

seems to fix the ascii_helper issue in this file.

#### 2013-02-05, 20:27:11 - Laurent Chauvin

## #648 Patch to support NDI usb<->serial top speed
Some newer NDI devices have a built-in usb<->serial converter, and the driver includes an aliased mode allowing transfer rate up to 1.2Mbps. See relevant portion of the API manual in attached image. 

The enclosed patch adds this support to vtkNDITracker and the relevant ndicapi files. It's a small patch but I want to address a few points before committing:

1) is there any upstream for ndicapi? 
2) I don't think there should be any effect for PLUS users with real serial devices who happen to use 19200, but I have no way to test this so would appreciate a once-over by someone with more NDI experience.

1) I'm not aware of any actively maintained version of ndicapi. In IGSTK they reworked it into a new class (igstkNDICommandInterpreter.cxx), in AIGS (https://raw.github.com/dgobbi/AIGS/master/Utilities/ndicapi/ndicapi.c) the file didn't change since 2005.

2) I agree. There should be no problem with this change. Feel free to commit.

status: changed from "New" to "Fixed"


## #649 NDI interface does not detect reset after INIT
NDI Polaris device was left in high-speed mode after exiting debugger. When PLUS sends INIT at 9600, the device resets back to default 9600 and returns status RESET. PLUS does not detect this as an error and proceeds to send further commands without re-issuing the INIT instruction which leads to the 'command not valid in current mode' error.

See #462 for more information.

The transform repository will contain 'Image_5cm_ToProbeTransform', 'Image_4.5cmToProbeTransform' (or similar, just an example) and the depth switching device will output the appropriate transform.

Metafile supports multiple raw files for one mhd file, but I guess not all the software tools are compatible with that and it would more work for us to implement it. So, I would prefer to just keep one file (or one header and one raw file).

## #654 TrackedFrame cannot support multi-image per frame (stereo cameras, etc...)
Discuss future steps (if any) to be taken to allow a tracked frame to support multiple images.

Consequences for MHA files as well.

#### 2013-01-22, 20:12:36 - Andras Lasso
I think we should just save each image sequence in separate mha/mhd file. Tracking data can be stored in all of them, the overhead should be negligible.

To replay: each file is read and replayed by a separate saved data source and their output streams are joined by a mixer device.

## #655 fCal device selector does not work
The device selector in fCal does not work (the devices appear but clicking on devices doesn't have any effect). Probably these error messages are related:

Object::connect: No such slot fCalMainWindow::DeviceSelected(device) in ..\\..\\PlusApp\\fCal\\fCalMainWindow.cxx:786
Object::connect:  (receiver name: 'fCalMainWindow')
Object::connect: No such slot fCalMainWindow::DeviceSelected(device) in ..\\..\\PlusApp\\fCal\\fCalMainWindow.cxx:786

Object::connect: No such slot fCalMainWindow::DeviceSelected(device) in ..\\..\\PlusApp\\fCal\\fCalMainWindow.cxx:786

There are other limitations of the device selector:
* It should be much more visible (near the connect button)
* It should be possible to define the device that is selected by default
* Probably we should be able to select a specific output stream instead of a device (how do you select a specific stream if you have a device that provides two video streams?)

The latest version doesn't perform the calibration well, so now the problem is not just with the display.
The problem is that TemporalCalibration::m_MovingSignal is empty. The reason for it is that vtkDataCollector::GetTrackingData doesn't call AddTrackedFrame for the tracker data tracked frame list.

#### 2013-02-12, 13:29:26 - Andras Lasso

## #658 Virtual disk capture device should write to ImageDirectory directory by default


#### 2013-01-23, 20:52:07 - Andras Lasso
I'm not sure if it's a good idea. Temporary files shouldn't be created in revision controlled directories.

#### 2013-01-23, 20:54:09 - Csaba Pinter
There is an OutputDirectory and ImageDirectory parameter in the PlusConfig.xml file. These were intended to define the default path for these operations.

#### 2013-01-23, 21:36:23 - Adam Rankin
Right, that's what I meant. The ImageDirectory location.

#### 2013-01-23, 21:36:32 - Adam Rankin
summary: changed from "Virtual disk capture device should write to TestImages directory by default" to "Virtual disk capture device should write to ImageDirectory directory by default"

#### 2013-01-23, 21:42:39 - Andras Lasso
The default config:

<PlusConfig
  LogLevel='3'
  DeviceSetConfigurationDirectory='F:/devel/PlusExperimental-bin/PlusLib/data/ConfigFiles'
  ImageDirectory='F:/devel/PlusExperimental-bin/PlusLib/data/TestImages'
  ModelDirectory='F:/devel/PlusExperimental-bin/PlusLib/data/CADModels'

So, the images should be saved into the *OutputDirectory* by default (not Testimages, nor ImageDirectory).


#### 2013-01-23, 21:46:28 - Csaba Pinter

## #660 Select stream instead of devices for data collection input
Currently a device has to be selected as an input when collecting data (  <DataCollection StartupDelaySec='1.0' DefaultSelectedDeviceId='TrackedVideoDevice' > ). This doesn't allow selection of a specific stream, in case the device provides multiple streams. It seems to be more convenient to specify a stream as input and use a mixer device if data should be collected from multiple streams.

Change DataCollection's DefaultSelectedDeviceId attribute to DefaultSelectedStreamId. Move GetTrackedFrames implementation from PlusDevice to PlusStream.

#### 2013-01-23, 21:49:26 - Adam Rankin
What is the use case when the user selects a stream that is not active and calls get tracked frame? PLUS_FAIL or an empty tracked frame or both?

#### 2013-01-23, 21:52:37 - Andras Lasso
What does 'active' mean?

#### 2013-01-23, 22:03:14 - Adam Rankin
vtkPlusDevice.CurrentStream is set by the device to point to the stream currently outputting data.

Is there a use case where a device will be outputting to multiple streams in parallel?

#### 2013-01-23, 23:01:55 - Andras Lasso
vtkPlusDevice.CurrentStream can only be an internal implementation detail of a device, as the device may change the CurrentStream with any frequency. Other devices that use the device cannot rely on the knowledge of the CurrentStream, because it can change anytime, and it would be impossible to properly propagate the CurrentStream changes of all devices to all other devices (each running in a different thread...).

Also, nothing is prepared for handling multiple images per stream: a tracked frame can only store a single video frame, a trackedframelist cannot store multiple images per item either, metaimage file doesn't support it either.

Moreover, some basic functionalities cannot be extended to multiple images per stream, because temporal interpolation of video data is not possible (this is a difference compared to tools, where temporal interpolation is completely doable). E.g., GetTrackedFrame(timestamp, outputTrackedFrame) is not feasible if the timestamps of the image buffers are not synchronized.

So, unfortunately (but better sooner than later), I think we should go back to the one image buffer per stream model.

If you are not convinced, then just try to properly implement the following functions to work properly for a stream that contain multiple image buffers:
PlusStatus vtkPlusDevice::GetOldestTimestamp(double &ts)
PlusStatus vtkPlusDevice::GetMostRecentTimestamp(double &ts)
double vtkPlusDevice::GetClosestTrackedFrameTimestampByTime(double time)
int vtkPlusDevice::GetNumberOfFramesBetweenTimestamps(double aTimestampFrom, double aTimestampTo)
PlusStatus vtkPlusDevice::GetTrackedFrameList( double& aTimestampFrom, vtkTrackedFrameList* aTrackedFrameList, int aMaxNumberOfFramesToAdd )
PlusStatus vtkPlusDevice::WriteToMetafile( const char* outputFolder, const char* metaFileName, bool useCompression /*= false*/ )
PlusStatus vtkPlusDevice::GetTrackedFrame( double timestamp, TrackedFrame& aTrackedFrame, bool enableImageData/*=true*/ )

They are not even simple for a single stream and they don't work correctly now (e.g., try to run the PlusServer with the attached config file). I think we only have a chance for a correct implementation if we don't complicate things any further and just implement the above functions at the stream level.

We can keep the current DataCollection element name, as it matches the class name better and there is no name conflict.

 VideoSourceId attribute should be renamed to VideoDataSourceId.

Unrelated, but once we are at changing the structure: having the DeviceSet as a DataCollection child element is not very good. The device set info attributes should be directly in the DataCollection element or the device set element should be at the same level as the DataCollection element.

## #666 Add a startup delay for devices that use other device output
For some devices it may take time to get ready for data collection. Previously, a single delay was implemented in the DataCollector (StartupDelaySec) and no data collection was attempted from the devices until this time period elapsed. However, the mixer device, the US simulator device, and all other devices that use inputs provided by other devices does not respect this waiting period, and therefore false warning or error messages may be displayed (see #643).

Proposed solution: during the startup delay period mixer (and similar) devices should not report errors or warnings if they don't receive anything from their input channels.

Would not any threaded device ignore the delay? It only delays the main thread.

I can refactor so that the delay is passed to each device, threaded devices will manage their own delay, and non-threaded devices will be covered by the 'global' data collector delay.

#### 2013-11-25, 16:05:22 - Andras Lasso
You are right, each device should receive the delay value. It would be just used for deciding to log an WARNING or DEBUG message when no input is available (if data is not received then log debug in the initial grace period after connection start, log a warning if it happens anytime later).

I've recently changed the logging when no input data becomes available to avoid logging errors. The logging in these two classes could be refined as shown below (and it should b generalized to all devices that rely on input from other devices):

* vtkUsSimulatorVideoSource:

change to LOG_WARNING/LOG_DEBUG depending on time after connect():
LOG_DEBUG('Simulated US image is not generated, as no tracking data is available yet. Device ID: ' << this->GetDeviceId() ); 

change to LOG_DEBUG:
LOG_INFO('Simulated US image generation started. No tracking data was available between '<<this->LastProcessedTrackingDataTimestamp<<'-'<<oldestTrackingTimestamp<<'sec, therefore no simulated images were generated during this time period.');

* vtkPlusOpenIGTLinkServer:

change to LOG_WARNING/LOG_DEBUG depending on time after connect():
LOG_DEBUG('No data is broadcasted, as no data is available yet'); 

change to LOG_DEBUG:
LOG_INFO('OpenIGTLink broadcasting started. No data was available between '<<self->LastSentTrackedFrameTimestamp<<'-'<<oldestDataTimestamp<<'sec, therefore no data were broadcasted during this time period.');

#### 2013-11-25, 16:37:02 - Andras Lasso
Commit #2987. I think we need to set the logging level (warning/debug) for missing input data depending how long ago the connection was established. If you've implemented this then it should be integrated. Actually delaying the output generation in devices is probably not a good idea anymore, because there could be a chain of devices that depend on each other, so devices should begin producing output as soon as they have all the required inputs.

## #668 Discussion regarding defining device output
After starting the refactor to remove the SelectedDevice and SelectedChannel concepts, I've run across a piece of code that made me re-think devices.

Why do we define the device output? Isn't the output of the device defined by the device?

For example: In the EpiphanVideoDevice, the InternalConnect used the SelectedChannel concept. However, there should only ever be one output channel for the Epiphan containing video, and that should never change. The only thing that should be changed is perhaps the behaviour of the device (aka BufferSize, etc...).

Anyways, this ticket is just to instigate a discussion about how we define devices.

The RF processor pre-computes conversion tables for the probe geometry, so changing parameters for each frame would not be feasible.

## #674 Add quick plane switching capability to BK biplane probes
With the current vtkBkProFocusVideoSource switching between sagittal and axial transducer requires disconnect and connect. Now Plus supports multiple output channels (each with a different video stream) for devices. However, the BK video source should be update to take advantage of this. The BK video source should detect which scan plane is used for each acquired frame and emit the video on the appropriate corresponding output channel.

Implementation steps:
* mechanism to get the plane info from BK (Andriy)
* second output channel (Andras, Adam)
* test everything with the real hardware (Andriy)


#### 2013-02-15, 15:55:04 - Andrey Fedorov
Getting plane info from BK update:

BK supports a list of events attached at the bottom of the message. Subscription to events is done as follows (we have oemClient in bkProFocusVideoSource):

this->oemClient->RegisterCallbackFunc(AutoUpdate, this->buffer, sizeof(this->buffer),'EVENT:');

When event arrives, buffer looks like this: 'EVENT:<event_type>;'. I tested, and this does work for events like FREEZE/UNFREEZE and TRANSDUCER_CONNECT (by the way, I think it may make sense to handle FREEZE event, to notify the user at least).

According to the BK technical contact, there is also event SCAN_PLANE that should be sent when sagittal/transverse arrays are switched on 8848. However, experiments show that when this switch happens, the event received is DIAGNOSTIC_SETUP_SELECTED, not SCAN_PLANE.

I emailed our contact at BK about the inconsistent event message, will update when hear back.

--- List of supported events ---

7.11 Event Messages
External -> Scanner
Event messages are used by the scanner to send back event notifications to external. The 
event messages always start with the token EVENT or the abbreviated token EVEN and are 
followed by a program message subtype that defines the event type. See section 7.4
Configuration Messages for details on how to set up the scanner to send event messages.
EVENT:SHUT_DOWN; Sent when the scanner is shutting down.
EVENT:ACQUIRE_3D_START; Sent when a 3D acquisition starts.
EVENT:NEW_PATIENT; Sent when a new patient is activated on the 
scanner.
EVENT:FREEZE; Sent when the scanner is frozen.
EVENT:UNFREEZE; Sent when the scanner is unfrozen.
EVENT:TRANSDUCER_CONNECT; Sent when a transducer is connected to the 
scanner.
EVENT:TRANSDUCER_DISCONNECT; Sent when a transducer is disconnected from 
the scanner.
EVENT:TRANSDUCER_SELECTED; Sent when a new transducer is selected as 
active transducer.
EVENT:DIAGNOSTIC_SETUP_SELECTED; Sent when a new Diagnostic Setup is selected.
EVENT:NEW_MEASUREMENT_RESULT; Message sent when a new measurement result 
is available.
EVENT:CROSS_HAIR_OUTSIDE_IMAGE; Message sent when a cross hair or some of its 
parts is placed outside of the shown ultrasound 
image.
EVENT:OEM_SYNCHRONIZATION; Message sent when the user-programmable key 
<OEM Synchronization> is pressed on the 
scanner.

I received the response from BK. They suspect there may have been be a bug in the Grabbie library, so they sent an updated one. I will now test with the new library to make sure the issue is resolved, then the new library need to be update to work with Plus video source (I think Andras did some fixes), and hopefully nothing else breaks. I did not have time to work on this today, will do on Friday and will update the ticket when I have news.

@lassoan: if you can give me a high-level idea what you changed in Grabbie, this might help. BK people told me there was not much changes in Grabbie functionality other than bug fixes and addition  of Matlab interface.

#### 2013-02-19, 21:28:56 - Andras Lasso
Grabbie was a huge mess. I had to clean it up a lot.

In the short therm the best is to a diff for the old and new Grabbie and redo the relevant changes in GrabbieLib (the cleaned up version).

In the long term they should clean up their Grabbie SDK. We can send our GrabbieLib to give them an idea what was wrong with their implementation and if needed I can review new Grabbie versions.

#### 2013-02-21, 15:15:52 - Andras Lasso
You can find the source code of both Grabbie-1.1.0 (the original SDK that BK provided) and the corresponding cleaned up GrabbieLib-1.1.0 in PLTools/BK/ProFocus. The structure of the code and file names are the same, so with a compare tool you can see what changes were made.

#### 2013-02-22, 19:27:23 - Andrey Fedorov
Comparison of Grabbie 1.1.0 and 2.2.0 showed there are no relevant changes. After additional communication with BK team, it turned out the mechanism to subscribe to these events is a bit different:

 this->parSyncConnection->SendOemQuery('CONFIG:DATA:SUBSCRIBE \\'SCAN_PLANE\\';');

This appears to work as expected.

Recommend:
Instead of a single vtkInternal, we have a list of them, each one corresponding to a certain ID (transducer? plane? aggregate ID?)

When a scan plane switch event is triggered, we record the current vtkInternal and when new data is acquired, we allocate data to the channel in the current vtkInternal

This would require that at least one output channel exists for each possible output type (as usual)

#### 2013-05-24, 20:14:46 - Adam Rankin
There's a lot we can do here. We can subscribe to the following events:
TRANSDUCER
SCAN_PLANE

We can also query TRANSDUCER_LIST to retrieve a full list of transducers attached.
We can also query some of the values of each transducer by providing the connector ID.

#### 2013-05-27, 20:52:56 - Andras Lasso
It should be enough to detect if the user switched between two predefined scan planes.

Instead of duplicating the vtkInternal we should just define a ScanPlaneInfo structure that contains SCAN_PLANE-specific information and put into the vtkInternal class:
* std::vector<ScanPlaneInfo> (or std::map<std::string, ScanPlaneInfo>)
* int ActiveScanPlaneIndex (or std::string ActiveScanPlaneId)


#### 2013-05-27, 21:08:36 - Andrey Fedorov
It might be a good start to first support multiple scan planes as defined in the config file, and when a different plane is selected by the user, re-query the parameters over OEM.

## #675 Tune Phidget sensor fusion parameters
With rotation along a fixed axis the Phidget sensor 'OrientationSensor' tool appears to provide a more complex trajectory (not just a rotation along a single axis, but also some transient twisting).

Tune the parameters, so that the sensor fusion works correctly for a 180deg rotation around a horizontal axis at a 3-4deg/sec speed.

#### 2013-05-17, 14:54:35 - Andras Lasso
The issue that they have is that currently none of the sensor fusion algorithms in PLUS work well enough for this relatively simple task:
* the TiltSensor mode doesn't do any sensor fusion or filtering therefore it's very noisy
* the OrientationSensor mode with magnetometer (AHRS mode) is not reliable due to inhomogeneous magnetic field
* the OrientationSensor mode without magnetometer (IMU mode) has rotation drift (around the 'down' axis, as there is no compass and the measurement of the heading only relies on gyroscopes)

What should work: use the IMU algorithm but constrain the rotation around the 'initial down direction' to 0 (we would request that they move the transducer to horizontal position when they turn on the system, that would be the initial down direction). We may need to tune the sensor fusion parameters as well. Need to verify the results with optical tracker measurements.


#### 2013-05-17, 15:05:45 - Andras Lasso
@fedorov: Could you attach the header file of a few typical sequences? (so that we can determine the optimal parameters for that rotation speed)

#### 2013-05-17, 16:09:39 - Andras Lasso
Magnetometer may not be reliable and may require frequent re-calibration. How to prevent drift when no magnetometer is used?

In vtkPhidgetSpatialTracker::SpatialDataHandler':

Option A: change the gyroscope input (before calling tracker->AhrsAlgo->UpdateIMU(...)) of the sensor fusion algorithm (basically force the measured rotation speed to 0 along the down axis)

Option B: change the output of the sensor fusion algorithm (after calling tracker->AhrsAlgo->UpdateIMU(...)) to snap the rotation around the down axis to 0 (e.g., represent the orientation with Euler angles in the south-west-down coordinate system and set the rotation value around the down axis to 0).

Probably option B would be simpler and more robust (with option A, some rotations around the down axis could still accumulate as a result of numerical inaccuracies).

I will try to book the equipment and do this on Friday.

I did the reconstructions from the data collected last week, and it does not look good. It's very noisy. I will try to repeat this with the phantom fixed in place.

In your experience, is there a constraint how quickly the probe can move with NDI?

#### 2013-05-20, 14:42:36 - Andras Lasso
Which data is noisy: the Phidget or the NDI tracker? Or the image data? Which NDI tracker do you use? With active or passive markers? NDI Polaris is not particularly sensitive to speed.

#### 2013-05-20, 14:47:13 - Andrey Fedorov
> Which data is noisy: the Phidget or the NDI tracker? 

Both :) But in this case I was talking about reconstruction from NDI only, the setup we used last week with the phantom was NDI + Epiphan. The setup was somewhat suboptimal (I had to start recording while holding the phantom and the probe, and the phantom was not rigidly attached to the table), so I will try again on Friday.

> Or the image data? Which NDI tracker do you use? 

We used NDI Polaris tracker that came with a Hologic US/CT fusion system.

   <Device
      Id='TrackerDevice'
      Type='PolarisTracker'
      SerialPort='5'
      BaudRate='115200'
      AcquisitionRate='50'
      LocalTimeOffsetSec='0'>

> With active or passive markers?

I believe these are passive markers -- snap-on shiny balls.

#### 2013-05-20, 16:36:14 - Andras Lasso
The Polaris with passive markers should be quite accurate, the error should be a few tenth of a millimeters. I didn't experience noise pose measurements with free-hand motion. If you used the motorized rotator and the noise of the pose measurement was only high during motion then it might be related to some vibration.

#### 2013-05-23, 13:32:54 - Andrey Fedorov
@lassoan: is there a tool that would allow to explore different fusion parameters/algorithms for a stored dataset? 

You mentioned using fusion algorithm with/without magnetometer, but I have never tried without magnetometer -- AhrsAlgorithm='MADGWICK_MARG' in acquisition config file. I only tried TiltSensor and OrientationSensor from the saved sequence file captured with these settings.

It would be nice to have a standalone tool so I can specify algorithm in config file, and it would produce an extra transform based on algorithm/parameters in a saved sequence file. If there is no such tool, I can try to make one. Please let me know if you or @Anderson_PERK have it.

#### 2013-05-23, 14:19:45 - Andrey Fedorov
@lassoan: 

1) can you clarify what you mean by the following: 'The angularRate parameters should be updated before calling tracker->AhrsAlgo->UpdateIMU(...) in vtkPhidgetSpatialTracker::SpatialDataHandler' ?

2) Phidget manual describes a procedure to calibrate magnetometer for the specific environment, otherwise the measurements may not be useful: http://www.phidgets.com/docs/1056_User_Guide#Magnetic_Error_Correction_.28Calibration.29 Is there a reason you think this is not necessary?

> It would be nice to have a standalone tool so I can specify algorithm in config file, and it would produce an extra transform based on algorithm/parameters in a saved sequence file. If there is no such tool, I can try to make one.

We don't have a standalone tool for recomputing the sensor fusion results from raw data. It would be nice if you could create such a tool.

> The angularRate parameters should be updated before calling tracker->AhrsAlgo->UpdateIMU(...) in vtkPhidgetSpatialTracker::SpatialDataHandler

This is a note to Ryan about how to prevent drift when no magnetometer is used. Option A (that is described in the note): change the gyroscope input of the sensor fusion algorithm (basically force the measured rotation speed to 0 along the down axis). Option B: change the output of the sensor fusion algorithm to snap the rotation around the down axis to 0 (e.g., represent the orientation with Euler angles in the south-west-down coordinate system and set the rotation value around the down axis to 0). Probably option B would be simpler.

> Phidget manual describes a procedure to calibrate magnetometer for the specific environment... Is there a reason you think this is not necessary?

It could work, however you may need to perform the calibration before each procedure (which may be difficult, because it requires rotation along all axes, while the transducer motion is constrained by the stabilizer) and it's not guaranteed that the calibration can fully compensate the presence of all distortion. As we need rotation angle only along one axis (which is not the down axis), we should be able to get that angle without relying on a magnetometer - with one of the options described above.

#### 2013-05-23, 15:02:53 - Andrey Fedorov
Andras, another problem with magnetometer is that the sensor is located relatively close to the motor.

I looked at the measurements from the gyroscope alone, and the angular rate for the second axis seems quite stable, see plot attached (mean 3.5 deg/sec stdev 0.24 for the slow portion of the sweep). Do you think a simple solution that uses this single measurement with perhaps some averaging over consecutive frames could be sufficiently good?

The drift of the angle value is probably negligible during a single acquisition, so you can integrate the angular velocity to get rotation angle value. Make sure you use all the 3 sensor directions, if the sensor axis is not aligned exactly with the transducer rotation axis.

#### 2013-05-23, 15:57:41 - Andrey Fedorov
re all 3 sensor directions, not sure, since the signal is very noisy for the other two. mean/std is 17 for the primary one, and ~1 for the other two. The sensor is roughly in good alignment with the rotation axis, since we have a fixed position attachment adapter.

#### 2013-05-23, 16:37:04 - Andras Lasso
I guess stdev is the same for all gyro axes. If the alignment is perfect then you have non-zero mean on one axis and zero mean on the two others.

#### 2013-05-24, 20:53:37 - Andrey Fedorov
You are right, I don't know what I was thinking ... 

Regarding optical tracking together with Phidget: I will first work to design an attachment to allow consistent placement of the star. Calibration procedure for the transrectal probe is very cumbersome, and currently has to be repeated every time. I think we can improve this. I was working on another sub-project with US today, and decided not to spend time on joint tracking until I have a robust system.

#### 2013-05-28, 19:47:02 - Andras Lasso
* Reproduce drfiting accelerometer measurements (move the accel while zeroing, if needed)
* Test if the updated algo stops the rotation around the down axis
* Option A: constrain by decomposing to rotation around SWD axes and setting D rotation component to 0 (assume that initial orientation of the tracked object is SWD). Option B: assume that one of the sensor's axes always points to W (similar to tilt sensor).
* Find a good name for the new coordinate system (RelativeTiltSensor for Option A, FilteredTiltSensor for Option B)

The above config file works with the the updated filtered tilt sensor.
The AHRS algorithm and algorithm parameters can be changed independently for the tilt sensor and filtered tilt sensor.

#### 2013-05-31, 00:28:08 - Andras Lasso
@fedorov: We've completed the sensor fusion implementation for the tilt sensor.  Use the PortName='FilteredTiltSensor' to get a drift-free (no rotation drift around the down axis) and reduced-noise orientation matrix. Set these parameters:
* FilteredTiltAhrsAlgorithm='MADGWICK_IMU' => you can also try MAHONY_IMU
* FilteredTiltAhrsAlgorithmGain='1.5' => you can try to change this parameter (it balances between noise suppression and quick convergence to the accelerometer-measured orientation)
* FilteredTiltSensorWestAxisIndex='1' => specify here the axis number (0, 1, or 2) of the tilt sensor axis that is parallel to the rotation axis (points towards the tip of the transducer)

Ideally, this should be tested with the motorized stepper and with the optical tracker as ground truth, but if you don't have access to the motorized stepper then it's enough if you can just do some manual testing.

I will test. I don't know if I will be able to do this tomorrow. I have few critical deadlines, and may need to postpone.

Also, Andras - regarding my earlier question if the filter can be applied to previously recorded data. I just thought can't it be done by specifying the recorded sequence file as data source and replaying it?

#### 2013-05-31, 03:42:42 - Andras Lasso
Currently the sensor fusion algorithm files are only used privately by the PhidgetSpatial class, so we need to reorganize the code to make it available to Plus applications. Then the tool to re-computate sensor fusion results from recorded raw measurement data can be implemented. Probably it's better to create a new tool for that, very similar to the existing PhidgetVolumeReconstruction tool, we could call it SpatialSensorFusion.

I'll do this code reorganization tomorrow (Friday) => #770
@Anderson_PERK: after the code reorganization is ready, please implement this SpatialSensorFusion tool (you'll need this for your work anyway) => #771

@Andriy,

A SpatialSensorFusion tool (see Diagnostic_and_test_tools page) was created to allow post-processing of raw sensor data to get quite noise-free but still accurate orientation. The computed orientation is stored in the FilteredTiltSensorToPhidgetTracker transform.

Example for obtaining filtered tilt sensor data from raw accelerometer+gyroscope data:

set PLUS_BIN_DIR=c:/Users/lasso/devel/PlusExperimental-bin/bin/Release
set DATA_DIR=c:/Users/lasso/devel/PocketUsTracking/trunk/data/Phidget Data/20130702-BwhPhidgetOptical/

%PLUS_BIN_DIR%/SpatialSensorFusion.exe --ahrs-algo=MADGWICK_IMU --ahrs-algo-gain 0.01 --initial-gain 1 --initial-repeated-frame-number=1000 --input-seq-file='%DATA_DIR%/TransrectalProbeRotatedPhidgetPolaris.mha' --output-seq-file='%DATA_DIR%/TransrectalProbeRotatedPhidgetPolarisReprocessed.mha' --west-axis-index=1 --tracker-reference-frame=PhidgetTracker 

Based on the off-line reprocessing, the 0.01 gain value seemed to be the best (low noise, still accurate angles compared to the optical ground truth) for the filtered tilt sensor. See the results in attached charts above (comparing the orientation sensor, tilt sensor, and filtered tilt sensor tools to the ground truth optical tracker tool)

The FilteredTiltSensor tool is available also in real-time during acquisition. It would be great if you could double-check that the this tool gives optimal result during acquisition as well, with the same 0.01 gain value (during acquisition we have access to the full frame rate of the PhidgetSpatial sensor, so there may be slight differences).

See PlusConfiguration_NoVideo_Phidget.xml config file for an example for adding the FilteredTiltSensor tool to your config file (https://www.assembla.com/code/bm1A8eCNSr4l2deJe5cbCb/bnyqsQCNSr4l2deJe5cbCb/commit/2914).

#### 2013-07-12, 13:20:45 - Andrey Fedorov

Trying to enable Phidget on my Linux machine (this is where I keep all the data and do the processing) leads to this error:

I processed 11 cases today, and in all cases gyroscope based reconstruction was visually superior to sensor fusion. There appears to be some drift remaining. I will next attach another example where it is quite prominent. Same settings were used for sensor fusion in all cases. 

There were some problems with gyroscope sensor measurements in some cases, but maybe I will report those separately. The good thing is I think I have 11 relatively good volumes for the US/MR study, and 2 more I need to look a bit more, because there were some issues with the config file structure (those were collected in the times of transitioning to multi-channel setup).

## #678 NDI Polaris fails to connect when on port > N
When attempting to connect from SonixTouch, the device was installed on COM10. The ndicapi failed to connect.

#### 2013-02-13, 03:25:40 - Andras Lasso
NDI's architect software can connect correctly even on this Windows XP embedded system.
However, even a standard terminal emulator (mttty) cannot connect to the serial line at COM10. Maybe on Windows XP embedded some different serial API has to be used?

#### 2014-05-22, 21:17:53 - Andras Lasso
The problem is most likely due to the different port naming convention for ports >10

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/115831

CreateFile() can be used to get a handle to a serial port. The 'Win32 Programmer's Reference' entry for 'CreateFile()' mentions that the share mode must be 0, the create parameter must be OPEN_EXISTING, and the template must be NULL. 

CreateFile() is successful when you use 'COM1' through 'COM9' for the name of the file; however, the message
INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE
is returned if you use 'COM10' or greater. 

If the name of the port is \\\\.\\COM10, the correct way to specify the serial port in a call to CreateFile() is as follows:
   CreateFile(
      '\\\\\\\\.\\\\COM10',     // address of name of the communications device
      fdwAccess,          // access (read-write) mode
      0,                  // share mode
      NULL,               // address of security descriptor
      OPEN_EXISTING,      // how to create
      0,                  // file attributes
      NULL                // handle of file with attributes to copy
   );
      
NOTES: This syntax also works for ports COM1 through COM9. Certain boards will let you choose the port names yourself. This syntax works for those names as well.



#### 2014-05-22, 21:24:29 - Andras Lasso
Proposed solution: allow the user to specify the full COM string in the config file and/or fix ndicapi_serial.h and other related files to generate COM port names dynamically, for any port number

Currently:

#define NDI_NUMBER_OF_DEVICES 7
#define NDI_DEVICE0    'COM1:'
...

  dirp = opendir('/dev/');

    return NULL;
  }

  while ((ep = readdir(dirp)) != NULL && j < 4) {
    if (ep->d_name[0] == 'c' && ep->d_name[1] == 'u' &&
        ep->d_name[2] == '.')
    {

        strncpy(devicenames[j],'/dev/',5);
        strncpy(devicenames[j]+5,ep->d_name,255);
        devicenames[j][255+5] == '\\0';
        closedir(dirp);
        return devicenames[j];
      }
      j++;
    }
  }
  closedir(dirp);
  return NULL;

This exact situation is happening when I increment the VTK version number.

http://markmail.org/thread/pbsymaks4teechii#query:+page:1+mid:jrrvghvd2korke27+state:results

However, I don't understand what he means by



~~~~

Then make sure you have specified vtkMath lib in your CMake file or project page (if you are not using CMake).


~~~~



First off, there is no vtkMath, it is part of vtkCommon.
Second, isn't this all internal to VTK? We've changed the library output path, but it's separated by Debug/Release folders... Do we need to tell vtkQtCharts where to look for the vtkCommon dll?
Third, which CMake file is he referring to?

## #680 Migrate to ITK 4.4.0
Slicer uses ITK 4.4.0, it would be good to match that version.

#### 2013-04-05, 23:28:14 - Adam Rankin

@rankin: Slicer uses this one. This has version 4.4.0. Strange that you found an older 'latest'. Maybe it is worth taking a look why.

I was wondering when the great migration would start. :-) I am looking forward to see ITK 4.4.0 in Plus.

#### 2013-04-07, 01:09:46 - Andras Lasso
Scheduled for Plus-2.0, which should be ready within a week or so.

#### 2013-04-07, 18:57:01 - Adam Rankin
The commit d6d726157f87cb47af0db9a44180768024f2d804 is the change to 4.4.0

They have not made a tag for this release yet. Does this mean it is still considered unstable?

The latest git tag is indeed 4.3.1

#### 2013-04-07, 18:57:41 - Adam Rankin
1866ef42887df677a6197ad11ed0ef6e9b239567 is some commit after 4.4.0

Do we know why it is used in slicer and not the change to 4.4.0? If we are using a non-final release, why not go with something more recent?

#### 2013-04-07, 19:09:24 - Adam Rankin
Also, major issue.

itkThreadSupport.h does this:
#ifdef ITK_USE_WIN32_THREADS
#ifndef _WIN32_WINNT
#define _WIN32_WINNT 0x0400
#endif
#endif

#### 2013-04-07, 19:10:09 - Adam Rankin
3d connexion tracker requires this
typedef struct tagRAWINPUTDEVICE {
    USHORT usUsagePage; // Toplevel collection UsagePage
    USHORT usUsage;     // Toplevel collection Usage
    DWORD dwFlags;
    HWND hwndTarget;    // Target hwnd. NULL = follows keyboard focus
} RAWINPUTDEVICE, *PRAWINPUTDEVICE, *LPRAWINPUTDEVICE;

which is #if(_WIN32_WINNT >= 0x0501)

#### 2013-04-07, 19:17:07 - Adam Rankin
I have avoided this problem temporarily by surrounding 3dConnexion building with a CMake option and disabling it.

At the moment, I could enable ITK4.4.0 by disabling 3dConnexion support.

Edit: I will leave the CMake option for 3dConnexion tracker, but this is also the wrong approach

#### 2013-04-07, 19:25:50 - Adam Rankin
I am also able to make everything work by commenting out the #define in itkThreadSupport.h

Not sure if that #define is really necessary.

Edit: wrong approach, ignore this

#### 2013-04-07, 19:32:16 - Adam Rankin
Ah, I understand a bit more now.

@lasson Would it be acceptable for PLUS to define the necessary windows defines to mandate Windows XP or later?
@pinter same

Example:
#define NTDDI_VERSION 0x05010000
#define _WIN32_WINNT 0x0501
#define WINVER 0x0501

(Require XP with no service pack at minimum)

Edit: Or use CMake configuration to specify -D_WIN32_WINNT=0x0501 etc...

#### 2013-04-07, 19:49:57 - Adam Rankin
The MicronTracker API attempts to define _WIN32_WINNT to 0x0400 as well... Why is it not protected by an #ifndef!!!!

@lassoan Andras, I'm assigning this to you so you can confirm that this is an acceptable solution. I don't think the restriction is too unreasonable and it allows us to move to ITK 4.4.0

Minimum Windows XP? Windows XP SP2 reached end of support 2+ years ago, so we don't really care about that. We currently support Win7 32/64 and WinXPe (see https://www.assembla.com/spaces/plus/wiki/Developers_guide).

@rankin:
Does fCal and PlusServer work on SonixTouch (it's WinXPe)?
Can 3dConnexion be enabled when building on Win7 32/64?


#### 2013-04-07, 23:43:15 - Adam Rankin
Ok, sounds good.

Our support of Windows XP embedded means that we have to support 0x0501 at minimum. We could possibly enforce SP3 0x050103 but so far, our software does not require it (except for device drivers maybe).

I will go run a test this evening and report back re: SonixTouch (I think it will be fine though)

I will create a more advanced CMake script to dynamically populate the windows defines as accurately as possible.

A few things to consider/fix:
* If it's possible to define the _WIN32_WINNT=0x0501 in the common header file (PlusConfigure.h, which all Plus files include), then I would prefer that over adding ADDITIONAL_CXX_FLAGS. It's simpler to keep track of all defines if they are in a header files. Keeping ADDITIONAL_CXX_FLAGS consistent across all projects (especially when some projects are built outside Plus, e.g., when using Plus libraries in a Slicer module) can be quite complex.
* Remove the red message (-D _WIN32_WINNT=0x0501) when configuring PlusBuild
* Remove 'what what' message in PlusLib\\src\\DataCollection\\CMakeLists.txt

## #688 PlusServer does not send reply if XML parser fails.
PlusServer should always send a reply to the client, even if the command message cannot be parsed.
Otherwise the client cannot display an error message to the user, or can only use timeout to guess that there won't be a reply.

#### 2013-04-02, 15:42:00 - Andras Lasso
I guess the problem is that if the command is invalid then the command processor does not even know the device name, so you get a response from the 'CommandProcessor' device. As the device names don't match, the Slicer module doesn't detect this as a response. Tamas, could you please check if this is what's happening? If yes, then maybe a solution could be to check CommandProcessor events and if you receive a 'Failed to create command from string: ' error then display the error. Maybe there could be a timeout in the for the waiting for the response. Maybe also the returned invalid command string could be compared to the commands that are waiting for a reply and if there is an exact match then that command can be set completed as failed.

#### 2013-04-02, 15:56:05 - Tamas Ungi
Yes, you are right. A message arrives to Slicer. Device name is Command Processor and the message as you said. It would be somewhat easier to catch this reply if there was a reference to the device name (e.g. RC1). Would that be possible?

#### 2013-04-02, 16:01:44 - Adam Rankin
Technically it's trivial, I don't know if it's the correct solution because it's not the device that's reporting an error, but the system.

Andras?

#### 2013-04-02, 16:37:36 - Tamas Ungi
Right now, the command-reply pair is identified by the device name in Slicer. Note that I refer to the device name parameter of the OpenIGTLink string message (not what we call 'device' in PLUS). The OpenIGTLinkRemote module creates a new, unique OpenIGTLink device name for every command (e.g. RC1) it sends to PLUS, and pairs the response to it by expecting a message with matching device name (e.g. RC1Reply).

So, it would be good to refer to RC1 (or whatever the OpenIGTLink device name is in the string message) so Slicer knows which command had this XML parsing error. Easiest would be to set RC1Reply as device name on the response.

I thought that if we cannot parse the command then we don't know the device name, but fortunately the device name comes in the message header, so it's all good. Tamas, let us know how it works now.

Andras, just to make sure this does not miss your attention.

Some of the Phidget tools are dropping signal (you told me it's a known issue). From Isaiah's experience, if the tracker drops the signal, this leads to degraded performance for the video stream. He is telling me that is also a known bug, in Plus. I cc Isaiah in case I am missing something.

The mouse interaction seems fine with the saved dataset device. The fix in ticket #696 fixed it most probably as flipping the image flips the coordinates as well, but now the image is in MF orientation internally in every case.

#### 2013-04-05, 03:53:03 - Andras Lasso
Yes, I think you can close this ticket with this short-term solution and enter a new ticket for implementing the final solution (to use the same orientation in the segmentation dialog as in the main viewer).

#### 2013-04-05, 12:52:18 - Csaba Pinter
Sorry I didn't hit submit yesterday.
So I think as the internal image orientation is always MF, and the pattern recognition algorithm also works on MF orientation, it is not important to see the image as it is seen in the main viewer, especially that the segmentation parameters have to be set once for each device set and depth.
I would consider applying the user orientation to the Segmentation Parameter Dialog a convenience feature with low priority.

## #694 If there are too many messages in the StatusIcon window, fCal needs a lot of time to recover
It looks as if would hang for even a minute when there are too many messages in the window that we can open from StatusIcon. I'm pretty sure it's the rendering of the messages that causes this.

## #695 Saving temporal calibration result does not work
After doing temporal calibration (plots and result number are fine), I saved the configuration file, and the temporal calibration result was nowhere in the saved xml.
Used PCI framegrabber card with NDI Aurora, config file attached (I don't attach screenshot as that machine is not connected to the internet and it's tedious to always copy using usb stick).

## #696 US image orientation setting seems not to work
I realized the default orientation they set was not right, so I set the proper orientation (UF) in the config file.
I froze an image for the segmentation parameter dialog while holding the probe to see all the wires, from the direction of the top of the phantom (row 1), and taking care that the marked side of the probe matches the M letter on the fCal 2.0 phantom.
The attached image shows what I got. It can be seen that the 5th row is identified as the top one, while obviously it should one. Same for the left-right direction. Also the orientation arrows show MN.
I may miss something here, but this is what I tried and couldn't do.

In the image you can see the used config file. I can't prove that I loaded that one without closing the seg. param. dialog, but you can take my word for that.

In the meantime I try to play with the orientation setting options in fCal, maybe I can hack my way through.

The contribution process is described at http://www.vtk.org/VTK/project/getinvolved.html (and linked pages). Are you sure that we use the actor properly? Is there a fix for this in the latest VTK?

#### 2014-04-16, 18:43:59 - Csaba Pinter
I haven't contributed to VTK yet, only ITK once. The initial effort was quite big, but once you know how it works it should be easy enough. They have Mantis, mailing lists, dashboard... http://www.vtk.org/VTK/project/getinvolved.html

Have you checked if this has been fixed in the latest VTK version?

#### 2014-04-16, 18:49:10 - Adam Rankin
Well, I admit I don't understand why one works and the other doesn't. I looked into the underlying code and it seems to get the correct glyph and generate the correct image data.

By adding data->Modified() to url:https://github.com/Kitware/VTK/blob/master/Rendering/FreeType/vtkFreeTypeUtilities.cxx|vtkFreeTypeUtilities.cxx:1319 the issue is fixed.

This seems like the same problem I was having when updating the acquired image from MMF, I was updating scalar pointer pixels manually, and not calling modified afterwards.


#### 2014-04-16, 18:55:25 - Adam Rankin
I will send an email to vtk-developers first, to see what the response is.

#### 2014-04-16, 19:37:02 - Andras Lasso
In the meantime, I've found the ICCapturingSource issue: it's a singleton and therefore the settings are only read the first time after application start. When we disconnect/connect the old channels are still there, so if something changed in the config file it has no effect. I'll commit a fix soon.

re #696: Fixed issue with ICCapturing device not taking into account PortUsImageOrientation.

vtkICCapturingSource is a singleton and therefore the settings are only read the first time after application start. When we disconnect/connect the old channels are still there, so if something changed in the config file it has no effect. The fix was to clear the existing channels and tools at the beginning of configuration reading.

@rankin: Can you force an update without needing to patch VTK?

#### 2014-04-16, 21:30:49 - Adam Rankin
I will look into it. I don't think so though as the vtkImageData is calculated internally to the vtkTextActor3D.

I haven't investigated how the vertical actor* is working while the horizontal one isn't. I will throw a breakpoint in vtkImageData::Modified and see what happens.

## #701 Potential RF line buffer size mismatch in BK ProFocus image source
The following warning in  PlusBkProFocusReceiver.cxx is displayed in certain cases:

LOG_WARNING('Not enough space allocated to store all the RF samples. Input: '<<numberOfSamplePairsInInput<<', output: '<<numberOfSamplePairsInOutput);

Currently the warning has been disabled to reduce clogging of the error log, but we should investigate why this happens and fix it. If the warning is displayed then scanlines are cropped and axial spacing after scan conversion may be incorrect.

Even if we don't understand why the scanline length is inconsistent between Prepare and DataAvailable, we could dynamically allocate a larger buffer if we find that the already allocated buffer is too small.


#### 2013-03-15, 21:59:57 - Andras Lasso
@fedorov:
Do you have an idea why we see this warning now and why it wasn't displayed before?
Maybe because we switch probes and Prepare is called only once?
What are the logged numberOfSamplePairsInInput and numberOfSamplePairsInOutput values?


#### 2013-03-29, 13:13:25 - Andrey Fedorov

(In r:2629|plus:2629) re #701: adding 6 to numberOfRfSamplesPerLine eliminates the buffer size mismatch. Perhaps there is a fixed size header that is prepended. Tested both with curved and linear arrays on BK 8848.

#### 2013-03-29, 14:58:59 - Andras Lasso
It's a reasonable temporary solution, but the best would be to do some more debugging or ask BK developers to find out what causes it exactly.

We already know that there is a header (ResearchInterfaceLineHeader) of HEADER_SIZE_BYTES long, but maybe 
* the header is actually longer, or
* there is a footer as well (there is a ResearchInterfaceLineFooter type in Grabbie's ResearchInterface.h, so it seems quite possible), or 
* we have to use header->LineLength to determine the actual number of samples (and then there is a footer and the rest is just padding)

#### 2013-03-26, 02:31:19 - Adam Rankin
In the end I realized that it was correct all along and the only mistake was the improper setting of image orientation of the virtual mixer.

I found the code that automatically converted everything to MF format, so having MF as the default format for the 2d visualization was correct.

vtkPlusBuffer constructor sets it to MF, when an item is added, it is converted to the buffer orientation.

#### 2013-03-26, 13:40:39 - Csaba Pinter
Thanks!
So if I understand correctly there was a bug with converting the orientation to MF internally, and it was fixed in a different ticket. If so, can you set it to related?

## #708 Temporary file generation sometimes fails
How to reproduce:
* Use a PlusConfig.xml file like this:
<PlusConfig
  LogLevel='3'
  DeviceSetConfigurationDirectory='F:\\devel\\PlusExperimental-bin\\PlusLib\\data\\ConfigFiles\  esting'
  ImageDirectory='F:/devel/PlusExperimental-bin/PlusLib/data/TestImages'
  ModelDirectory='F:/devel/PlusExperimental-bin/PlusLib/data/CADModels'
  GnuplotDirectory='F:/devel/PlusExperimental-bin/PlusLib/tools/Gnuplot/binary'
  ScriptsDirectory='F:/devel/PlusExperimental-bin/PlusLib/src/scripts'
  Date='2013.03.27 17:30:56'
  EditorApplicationExecutable='notepad.exe'
  OutputDirectory='./Output'
  LastDeviceSetConfigurationFileName='F:/devel/PlusExperimental-bin/PlusLib/data/ConfigFiles/Testing/PlusConfiguration_NDIPolaris_Phidget.xml'/>

* Start fCal.
* Record something, use save as... to save it => saving is successful.
* Record something, use save as... to save it => saving fails.

Problem analysis:
* For the first recording relative path is resolved as: path = 'f:/devel/PlusExperimental-bin/PlusApp-bin/fCal/Output'
* For the second rec: path = 'F:/devel/PlusExperimental-bin/PlusLib/data/TestImages/Output' => this is not an existing directory, therefore temporary file name generation fails.
* Probably something has changed the current directory.

Corrective actions required:
* Paths in the PlusConfig.xml must be always relative to the location of the PlusConfig.xml file itself. Change vtkPlusConfig::GetInstance()->GetOutputDirectory() to always returns an absolute path because otherwise somebody might just mistakenly interpret it relative to the current working directory (as it happened this case).
* Make sure nothing ever changes the current directory in fCal, just in case there were other relative path references.

Do you know what caused the change in the current working directory of the application?

Also, need to fix the GetOutputDirectory() to return an absolute path (relative to the location of the PlusConfig.xml file), because at many other places the GetOutputDirectory() results is used as is (meaning relative to the current working directory instead of the PlusConfig.xml location).

## #709 GetOutputDirectory shall return a path relative to the PlusConfig.xml file location
Fix the GetOutputDirectory() to return an absolute path (relative to the location of the PlusConfig.xml file), because at many other places the GetOutputDirectory() results is used as is (meaning relative to the current working directory instead of the PlusConfig.xml location).

Using a relative path is quite error-prone, as the current working directory may change during the execution of programs.

Also, currently vtkPlusConfig::GetOutputDirectory() changes the current working directory. The current working directory must not be changed. Instead, every time a file is accessed then the appropriate path should be retrieved from vtkPlusConfig.

## #710 fCal crash when switching from BK to Epiphan device during acquisition
-----Original Message-----
From: Andriy Fedorov [mailto:fedorov@bwh.harvard.edu] 
Sent: March 29, 2013 9:01 AM

When fCal starts, it shows B-mode from BK device. If I try to switch to Epiphan stream - crash. It happens only in Release mode. Setting output level to Trace didn't show any helpful messages before the crash. For me this issue is not critical, I can proceed without it being fixed. But let me know if you would like to debug this.

Hi Andriy,

We do not have a BK device here in the lab, I will experiment with a few hardware configuration to see if I can reproduce it.

Cheers,
Adam

#### 2013-04-02, 16:33:31 - Adam Rankin
This is symptomatic of a larger threading issue. Able to reproduce with saved RF data with rf processing and a b-mode saved data set. Switching between channels will eventually cause a crash.

Yes, we have to be careful, as device methods can be called anytime from the main thread while data is being acquired by the data acquisition thread.
We should clearly define and document what member variables the data collector thread may modify (probably only the buffer contents).
Then all public methods of all devices (and the methods that these public methods call) should be prepared for these modifications happening at any time. It is doable if we very strictly limit the scope of modifications that the data collector thread may do.

#### 2013-04-03, 19:24:58 - Andrey Fedorov
Not sure if it's the same or different issue. Observed during the case last week. Since currently we need to reconnect each time the scan plane is changed, fCal crashed after one of the reconnections when trying to go to capture panel. I was able to reproduce this issue with Debug build today:

Connect to BK with linear array -> record all -> save all -> disconnect -> switch to curvilinear array -> connect -> crash:

Also, fCal element in the cofig file appears to be mandatory now, it was not in the past (BWH config file in PlusLib/data/ConfigFiles).

Ah yes, that fCal check needs to be after the select channel. That function must select a channel no matter what.

@rankin: I am not quite sure what you mean by the last comment -- just letting you know so that there's no misunderstanding. If I move that check after select channel, it will crash when the element is not present.

re #712: Moved package hardware compatibility matrix to Plus wiki

Moved package hardware compatibility matrix to Plus wiki.
In user manual only supported platforms information is kept.

It was too difficult to keep package contents (build machine configuration) in sync with documentation stored in source code.

## #714 Stylus (pivot) calibration test is not convenient to use
Reported by @ungi:

I think the problem is not with the PivotCalibrationAlgo. But how to read a file without video data. I cannot start vtkStylusCalibrationTest with this device config:

## #719 Errors when saving with VirtualBufferedDiscCapture in fCal
Used the 'Simulation mode for freehand spatial calibration with phantom 2.0 containing 3 NWires' config file.

Issues:
* Crash: open the config file and switch between the config and capture tabs repeatedly. When you switch to capture tab the second time fCal crashes in CapturingToolbox::RefreshContent due to 'widget' variable pointing to a deleted object.
* Save and snapshot buttons should be disabled during recording
* Snapshot should be added to the same file, see how the recording control works at the top
* If recording is too short then an error is logged that file moving failed (click record, wait 2 sec, stop, save, click record, wait to sec, stop, save)

## #720 Add CROP operation to EditSeqMetafile
from @lassoan:

'If you want to remove parts of the image after acquisition for anonymization purposes then you can use the FILL_IMAGE_RECTANGLE operation of EditSeqMetafile.

## #721 Include SVN release version into saved config file
This would be extremely helpful to keeping track of the code version used for capturing the saved data. Currently, the code appears to be not stable, and I am not able to do what I was able to do 2 weeks ago. But I am not sure which version I used!

Lesson for the future for me -- keep two separate versions of Plus -- one that is tested and works, and one for testing new features and improvements ...

#### 2013-04-11, 16:41:36 - Andrey Fedorov

## #724 Change RegionOfInterest segmentation parameter definition in the config files
In Plus users can specify rectangular region of interests by origin and size of the region (e.g., ClipRectangleOrigin='253 108' ClipRectangleSize='720 667').

The only exception seems to be the RegionOfInterest attribute of the Segmentation element in the device set configuration file: RegionOfInterest='27 27 793 589' (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax).

Change it to two parameters with the following names:
ClipRectangleOrigin (old parameters: xmin ymin)
ClipRectangleSize (old parameters: xmax-xmin+1 ymax-ymin+1; its maximum value is the size of the image)

## #725 Add descriptive name to vtkPlusBuffer for logging
Warning/error messages logged by vtkPlusBuffer are not very helpful, because the device&source IDs are not printed. Currently, the vtkPlusBuffer does not need to know these IDs (and it's very good like this), but just for logging purposes it would be useful to add a DescriptiveName member that would be added to log messages to identify which device:source has a problem.

I set the milestone to 2.0 because this feature would be useful for testing and optimization of Plus-2.0.

FrmGrab_Start should be called if the recording is not yet in progress (http://www.argocorp.com/grabber/eizou/Epiphan/pdf/Epiphan_SDK_ReleaseNotes.pdf, especially important for network grabbers), but it seems that the if (!this->Recording) check has wrong logic (when InternalStartRecording is called then I think the Recording is still false).

Check this with a real Epiphan hardware and fix the logic if needed.

As suspected, the code is borked.

Currently there is no issue for local grabbers as the grab/release execution model on a local grabber is sufficiently fast.
However, for network grabbers (from the SDK):


~~~~

FrmGrab_Start function signals the frame grabber to prepare for capturing frames with maximum frame rate. Currently, it doesn't matter for local grabbers, however it's really important for network grabbers. For network grabbers, this function turns streaming on, otherwise FrmGrab_Frame will have to work on request/response basis, which is much slower

#### 2013-04-15, 17:20:29 - Adam Rankin
Unfortunately SDK documentation is slightly outdated, FrmGrab_Start returns an int. I can't tell if 1 is good and 0 is bad or vice versa (I think 1 is good).

## #732 Question on using SonixTablet with Ascension 3D sensors
Hi,

I am new to the Plus library and have some basic configuration questions:

I am using a SonixTablet with Ascension 3D sensors.
I have downloaded Plus 1.8 on the SonixTablet and tried to run fCal.exe but none of the sonix configuration files work (connection failed error).
Could you help me get past my connection issues?
I noticed that the Sonix configuration files all have SonixVideo as the ImageAcquisition Type set to 'SonixVideo' but the PlusVersion.exe does not list SonixVideo as a supported video capturing device.

Thank you very much
nick

## #733 Set localhost as default Ultrasonix scanner default IP address
By default (if the user doesn't specify an IP address) then Ultrasonix scanners should use 127.0.0.1 address.

There is also a bug in vtkSonixVideoSource now that causes a small leak on each Reset(): this->SonixIP shall be initialized to NULL in the constructor, then with the set macro it should be set to the default value, in the destructor it should be set to NULL with the set macro, in Rest it should be changed with the set macro.


#### 2013-04-17, 15:46:56 - Andras Lasso
Actually, I'm not sure why this Reset() method needed at all - maybe due to the singleton stuff.
@heffter: Do you remember why we need to have the vtkSonixVideoSource as a singleton?

#### 2013-04-17, 16:00:11 - Adam Rankin
The reset is needed due to Sonix being a singleton. When a disconnect/reconnect cycle is done, there were channels leftover since the destructor wasn't called.

Another alternative is to do a class cleanup in InternalDisconnect, but that doesn't seem like the right place.

#### 2013-04-17, 16:03:15 - Andras Lasso
This whole singleton thing is quite ugly. We should get rid of it, if it's not absolutely needed.

#### 2013-05-22, 20:53:52 - Tamas Heffter
@lassoan Sorry, I've just seen your question. I think we used singleton because the Ulterius SDK cannot handle multiple connections, therefore we could use SonixVideo instance from more than one objects if needed. I don't think it's necessary, we just need to be cautious when we access it from different objects. 

#### 2013-05-22, 21:10:11 - Andras Lasso
Thanks for the info, entered #764 to track the conversion from singleton to simple object.

## #735 BK RfProcessing/ScanConversion parameters are not saved in config file

Would this be 
ImagingDepthMm='56.0'
from <ScanConversion> ?

#### 2013-04-17, 22:12:06 - Andrey Fedorov
This is the value that comes from the init config file.

And to be absolutely positive, it doesn't match the depth displayed on the screen, as captured by the Epiphan stream...

#### 2013-04-17, 22:14:26 - Andras Lasso
There can be some default depth in the input config file, but then the BK video source queries the scanner for the actual depth and saves it in the config files that are created along with the mha files.

@lassoan will sonix in rf mode with rfprocessing tag behave the same as bk? (for reproducing/testing)

#### 2013-04-17, 22:29:57 - Andras Lasso
Such mechanism hasn't been implemented for Ultrasonix. The final design will be somewhat different from what we can have now, as a switcher device will route the video stream to specific channels, so RF processing parameters won't be changed on the fly. However, until them I don't think we have any other solution than fixing the current mechanism for the BK.

It's the attribute that you found: ImagingDepthMm in <ScanConversion>.

#### 2013-04-18, 01:03:00 - Andrey Fedorov
I think the whole RfProcessing element is not written out. I will try to confirm tomorrow.

Ok! That I can test with the Sonix.

#### 2013-04-18, 17:32:45 - Adam Rankin
I'm unable to reproduce. When I add a RfProcessing element, it's write configuration is successfully called.

## #744 Fix Ultrasonix RF data interpretation
We receive udtRF data from Ultrasonix scanners (Exam software 5.7) with a dimension 2080x256 when using an L14-5 transducer with default imaging parameters. There is a slight shift in every second line.

In Plus the assumption was that the shift is due to IQ encoding, and therefore two lines were combined into one during brightness conversion step. However, this seems not to be the case, but each line should contain a simple real-value signal (http://research.ultrasonix.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=967&p=3665#p3665).

Once this information is confirmed, change the SonixVideo data source to interpret the data as US_IMG_RF_REAL instead of US_IMG_RF_I_LINE_Q_LINE (it should be just a matter of changing this enum).

Further comment from an Ultrasonix research scientist seem to confirm that this is a software bug in the 5.7 Exam software and it is fixed in 6.x:
'Since you have a SonixTouch, why don't you use 6.x instead of 5.x? This shouldn't be an issue in 6.x.
I think the effect has something to do with the time delay calculations that has been modified and improved greatly in the 6.x.'


#### 2013-05-01, 19:57:29 - Adam Rankin
Have they sorted out the ITK/VTK/etc... dependencies?

#### 2013-05-01, 20:20:04 - Andras Lasso
They plan to improve the situation, we can expect something later this year.

#### 2013-05-01, 21:31:15 - Thomas Kuiran Chen
The root cause of the VTK compatibility is that in 6.x software, we use a third party library (BCAD) which depends on a set of old VTK dlls (version 4) and is not compatible with the current VTK dlls.

This dependency however is only in Porta, not in Ulterius.  So if the part of Plus relying on Porta can be disabled (not sure if it is doable), then Plus can be built with the latest 6.0.4 software.  

But then, there is still the issue of QT dependency (the current 6.0.4 depends on QT 4.8.0), so if Plus uses any new features in QT 4.8.1 or later, it will not be compatible with the 6.0.4 software.

In the next 6.0.5 software (scheduled to be release some time this year), both issues should be resolved: we will remove BCAD dependency and rename QT dll to a different name so as not to conflict with user's own choice of QT version.



#### 2013-05-02, 13:02:47 - Adam Rankin
Currently we work with 4.7.4. I'd be interested in upgrading to a more modern release though.

#### 2013-05-02, 13:17:19 - Andras Lasso
We use Slicer's official QT version. Even if that matched the Ultrasonix SDK QT version, there could be still unresolvable conflict due to compiler version or build options mismatch.

#### 2013-05-02, 16:25:58 - Thomas Kuiran Chen
Perhaps it's better to wait for the 6.0.5 release where both VTK and QT issues will be addressed.  For compiler, is it feasible for Plus to upgrade to Visual Studio 2010?  We are using CMake in all development.

#### 2013-05-02, 16:35:30 - Adam Rankin
Yes, PLUS supports a 2010 build.

#### 2013-05-02, 16:37:29 - Andras Lasso
It's enough if standard QT, VTK, ITK DLLs are removed from the Ultrasonix SDK.
Ultrasonix SDK only uses simple C-style functions and POD structures on its interface (at least in 5.7 it does), so the SDK DLLs can be used from programs built with any compiler version.

#### 2013-05-02, 17:02:23 - Thomas Kuiran Chen
Yes, 6.0.5 will have a even cleaner interface.  There are only a few exceptions (some Porta interface and vector support) but they will be cleaned out eventually.  After 6.0.5, we will be removing MFC dependency and migrating to the new C++11 standard and Boost libraries (e.g., signal/slots, threads, i/o, etc.). Many more new features in Boost will become part of the next C++ standard and only be supported in Visual Studio 2010 (partially) and 2012 (fully).  So perhaps it is a good idea to build Plus with VS 2010 (as a standard) or newer.

## #746 Provide an example for computing  TransducerReferenceToProbe transform
We could provide a Matlab (and FreeMat-compatible) code snippet to:
* compute TransducerReferencePoint_Image point coordinates (a fixed point in the _Probe_ coordinate system that has the same coordinate values in the _Image_ coordinate system, regardless of the image depth) from two ImageToProbe calibration matrices obtained at different imaging depths. And a sample  
* compute TransducerReferenceToProbe transformation matrix from a ImageToProbe transformation matrix and TransducerReferencePoint_Image point coordinates (ImageToTransducerReference coordinate system: origin is TransducerReferencePoint, axis directions are the same as of the _Image_ coordinate system, unit is the same as the _Image_ coordinate system)
* compute rotation, scaling, and translation from TransducerReferenceToProbe transformation matrix

From the feedback we gathered in OEM customers, they simply want a breakdown of the 'Transform Image to Probe' into rotation, scaling and translation (in addition to the original Image to Probe matrix), in the XML file.  Something like:

Transform From='Image' To='Probe' - Rotation
Transform From='Image' To='Probe' - Scaling
Transform From='Image' To='Probe' - Translation

ImageToProbeTransform can be decomposed to rotation, scaling, and translation as

ImageToProbeTransform = ImageToProbeRotation * ImageToProbeScaling * ImageToProbeTranslation

where the components can be computed as follows:

ImageToProbeTranslation = [ eye(3), ImageToProbeTransform(1:3,4); 0 0 0 1];
ImageToProbeWithoutTranslation=ImageToProbeTranslation\\ImageToProbeTransform;
ImageToProbeScaling = diag([norm(ImageToProbeWithoutTranslation(:,1)), norm(ImageToProbeWithoutTranslation(:,2)), norm(ImageToProbeWithoutTranslation(:,3)), 1]);
ImageToProbeRotation = ImageToProbeWithoutTranslation*inv(ImageToProbeScaling)

It's probably not really useful to decompose the ImageToProbe transformation like this, but it could be more useful to do this for the UltrasoundToProbe transformation. See https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/plus/trunk/doc/tutorials/UltrasoundToProbeTransformComputation.pptx for computing the UltrasoundToProbe transformation.

## #747 Make the installed Plus package easier to use
1. Plus installed with NSIS installer does not have write permissions to its own directory
Windows 7 64 bit user in Administrators group

2. Add a shortcut for starting PlusServer from the Start menu

#### 2013-05-04, 12:27:35 - Andras Lasso
Where do you install it? In ProgramFiles? It's normal that you cannot modify files there, but I agree that it should be at least clearly documented.

You can change the PlusConfig.xml to point to a writeable output directory. Or, the PlusConfig.xml file could be overridden from the current working directory (and that could point to a user-specific output directory). Maybe the best would be to simply set the default install location to somewhere in the user's personal folder.

I don't think it's a high-priority issue (compared to other high-priority tasks).

#### 2013-05-04, 13:22:44 - Adam Rankin
priority: changed from "Highest (1)" to "Normal (3)"

#### 2013-11-25, 14:54:29 - Adam Rankin
Upon reflecting of the issue, it is abnormal that the default installation does not work out of the box. Most people that I have supported have all come up with their own workarounds to avoid this issue. It is not a very big deal, but it affects a large portion of users.

Perhaps the default install directory should be relative to the users home directory?

#### 2013-11-25, 16:43:22 - Andras Lasso
I agree, the package should be installed in somewhere in the user home. In the long term (if we don't expect any significant config file changes anymore) then we may consider installing Plus executables under program files and config files in the user home.

## #750 PlusServer unpredictable behaviour
I'm using the attached config file with SonixTouch + Ascension. I have the same workflow, but PlusServer works only a few times out of lots of trials. There are two kinds of errors I experience:
(All cases are run with the same command, same config file, attached Scoliosis_L14_v2746.xml)

1.
PlusServer starts, but hangs after 4 lines of output. PlusServer stays in this state (does not accept connections yet) for over 5 minutes, and can be stopped by lots of Ctrl+C keystrokes. The client (Slicer) is always in WAIT state. The SONIX application signals Connections.
See log file: PlusLog1.txt.

2.
PlusServer starts and runs till the 'Press Q or Ctrl-C to quit' message. But the connection with the client doesn't work. I tried connecting multiple times from Slicer. Slicer's IGTLConnection status also goes 'ON', but no data is transferred from PlusServer to Slicer. When trying to reconnect from Slicer, the status stays WAIT.
In these cases it takes a long time for Slicer to close,
Attached log file: PlusLog2.txt

3.
Correct behavior. Slicer can connect to PlusServer, and data is transferred continuously. Unfortunately this only happens once out of about 10 trials.
I attache a log file for this case too (PlusLog3.txt) just as an evidence that there is this kind of case too.

I couldn't detect any change on any computer (ultrasound or Slicer PC) between the different behaviors. After enough trials under the same circumstances all cases can be reproduced. In the dominant majority of the cases the first behavior happens, so PlusServer doesn't even start properly.

It seems there is a problem with setting the log level. In case of the short logs the messages were not logged at trace level. Of course this doesn't explain the reported errors, but still has to be investigated.

## #751 Image acquisition with Porta SDK fails
By nic.heron on 2013-04-18 20:47
now that I have PlusServer working with the Exam software, I would like to run it with the Porta SDK: I have a custom ultrasound application that uses the Porta SDK to produce ultrasound images and would like to know if I can use fCal with those images.
When I run fCal with a config file that has SonixPortaVideo it crashes...
I have attached the config file. The only difference between that file and the file that works with Exam is the ImageAcquisition type.
Thank you

@mbrudfors: Thanks for the commit. I've made some minor adjustments in the sample config file (see plus:3323).

No, that line of code was not used.

 if ( !this->Porta.findMasterPreset( name, MAX_NAME_LENGTH, code ) ) 

find the name when the paths are set correctly in the config file.

## #752 Volume reconstructor provides rounded output in weighted average compounding mode

## #754 Image acquisition through the BK Ultrasound OEM interface is slow
Currently the vtkBkProFocusOemVideoSource uses the capture_image query to retrieve images from BK ultrasound scanners one-by-one. This method is slow (about 3.5fps is the achievable frame rate), makes the BK scanner slow to respond, and the retrieved image contains all annotations burnt into the pixels, which may not always be desirable.

Also, it seems to impact the responsiveness (robustness?) of the BK scanner. Setting the acquisition frame rate in Plus to 1-2fps (or just acquire images on request) may help to avoid issues.

The solution to these is to use the grab on/off query instead.

#### 2013-05-07, 22:03:44 - Andras Lasso
Is it going to have a performance impact as well (extra copying)? Would be useful to do some performance testing to make sure the overhead of any extra copying and synchronization is negligible. With duplication of data it may be even possible that the performance will increase (as there may be less overhead in synchronization), but it's difficult to predict without actually trying it.

re #762: Fixed race condition at logger initialization

Problem was that AccurateTimer accessed the logger first, but while performing initialization, the application's main thread accessed the logger. The logger creation mutex was different from the logger access mutex and therefore the logger was used before fully initialized. The only side effect that was observed is that setting verbose level on the command line was ignored (because it was set from the main thread but later it was overwritten by the logger initialization process).

Solution: lock the logger access mutex as well until logger initialization is fully completed. The access mutex is locked even before setting the logger instance variable, so there is no time window at all for any thread to get access to the logger before it is initialized.

Initialization and deletion of singletons are difficult to control. Convert the SonixVideo source to a simple class instead of a singleton.

## #765 Update transform repository through PlusServer
For e.g.
when ReferenceToRAS transform needs to be recomputed (reference object moves) I need to update ReferenceToRAS transform to be identity. Then I need to collect fiducial points and recompute the registration. Then update ReferenceToRAS with the registration result.

It would be nice if I could do all this from Slicer. And many other small applications could be implemented with this in Slicer. E.g. stylus calibration.

To make the updates permanent, we also need a way to save the new configuration into the config file by PlusServer.

#### 2013-05-23, 05:49:33 - Tamas Heffter
I'll need this feature as well, because I'd like to avoid the need of storing the same repository on the client and on the server as well. In my case the server will run on the US system and the connected client wants to display the calibrated, tracked US. Right now, it's really painful to select, store and maintain the same configuration chunks all the time on two different computer, so I was planning to make TransformRepository IGTLink message type to transfer the repository if needed. With this approach I could only store connection related settings on the client and maybe just send a request to change the depth on the server with of course changing the calibration result as well (maybe stored in the config file for different depths). 

#### 2013-05-23, 15:24:37 - Andras Lasso
The long-term solution for the depth change is to use a switcher virtual device, but as a short-term solution manual update of transform in the repository could work as well.

Is remote depth changing required? Or do you have physical access to the machine?

#### 2013-05-27, 17:06:59 - Tamas Ungi
The issue of remotely changing depth hasn't come up yet. I think the direction is the other way. When we know the user has changed the depth on the ultrasound machine, we just need to use another ImageToProbe transform. Ultrasonix has this special possibility that we can request the depth setting from PLUS, so we could switch ImageToProbe transforms automatically. But in case of other ultrasound machines somebody will have to manually press a button on the client application (Slicer) too, to request another ImageToProbe transform from PlusServer. And manually make sure the depth setting is the same on both machines.

I would trigger a transform repository message send on depth change, and on the client side we can develop the response as we wish, either notify the user before we apply transform or whatever. This was pretty common issue when we were in the OR and the clinician just wanted to change the depth. So we always had to stop the server, select the right config file, restart and reconnect clients.

## #767 Allow stylus calibration for already-calibrated stylus
Currently during stylus calibration in fCal, points are only collected if there is sufficient variation in the translation component of the StylusToReference transform. However, this means that if the stylus is already calibrated, users just see that data collection doesn't work.

We require users to do the followings (https://www.assembla.com/spaces/plus/wiki/System_calibration):
'No points can be collected during stylus calibration
If the stylus has been calibrated already (e.g., with the NDI toolviewer) then the stylus position remains the same when the stylus is pivoted around its tip. The stylus calibration method requires unique positions, therefore the algorithm will not work if it is attempted to apply on an already calibrated stylus.
If the stylus has been already calibrated outside PLUS then just add the following calibration matrix to the CoordinateDefinitions element in the device set configuration file:
<Transform From='StylusTip' To='Stylus' Matrix='1 0 0 0   0 1 0 0   0 0 1 0   0 0 0 1' Date='2010.01.01 10:00:00' /> '

Actually, we could just check if there is variation in orientation, and if there is enough variation then still collect points. If we find that all the collected point positions are very similar then we don't do a stylus calibration (to avoid numerical problems), just use identity transform as StylusTipToStylus.

#### 2013-11-26, 17:13:09 - Adam Rankin
Should I add a button to the GUI to let them override the algorithm with an identity matrix? I could also add a bit of logic in the algorithm to flag a suspected pre-calibrated stylus and present a message to the user telling them to override.

Thoughts?

#### 2013-11-26, 17:21:55 - Andras Lasso
The user may not know if the stylus is calibrated already or not, so we have to allow running  a calibration to confirm that it is indeed calibrated.

The only problem is that point collection currently fails for calibrated styluses as the algorithm expects changes and the criteria is a change in translation. The correct solution would be to check for changing in orientation (that means that we are pivoting).

Ok, I will do some modification to detect change in orientation without change in translation (with threshold) and present the user with the option to set the stylus calibration matrix to the identity.

#### 2013-11-27, 16:41:28 - Adam Rankin
The code indicates that it is considering change in orientation as well as change in translation. Has this already been fixed but simply wasn't reported?

#### 2014-06-04, 13:37:22 - Andras Lasso
There are a couple of issues with the current fCal-L1.4 phantom:
* The landmark positions and the STL model are not aligned accurately (see the yellow dots in the attached Attachment LegoLandmarksInaccurate.jpg). Either the landmark positions are not computed but manually marked (impacts calibration accuracy) or the displayable STL model is manually registered to the phantom coordinate system (only a display issue).
* There seems to be unnecessary parts, unnecessarily different colors (it would be enough to have a different color for each layer), unnecessary variations (the wall is 1x thick at some places and 2x thick at other places). Note: it may be difficult for people to get parts with specific colors (unless they custom order it), so we should not rely much on colors.
* The IGTSK Lego phantom (http://yanivresearch.info/igiTutorial/igiTutorial.html) uses the 'Deluxe Brick Box Building Set (6167)' (see http://brickset.com/inventories/6167-1 for complete inventory). It would be nice if our phantom could be constructed from that kit, too.

## #772 vtkLineSegmentationAlgo only returns LineParameters for frames that were successfully segmented
vtkLineSegmentationAlgo only returns LineParameters for frames that were successfully segmented. It's a problem, because in case of segmentation failures the correspondence between the original frame indices and the returned line parameters are lost.

## #775 Tracker reference frames must be unique across all devices
currently devices default to 'Tracker', verify uniqueness if defined and generate unique if not

#### 2013-06-13, 19:18:43 - Andras Lasso
Uniqueness is theoretically not necessary (it may be possible that two devices have exactly the same 'To' coordinate system), but in practice all these 'To' coordinate systems are different.

Probably the best would be to use the device name by default (that is also guaranteed to be unique), but it's not backward compatible. To maintain reasonable compatibility I would recommend the following:
* For now: just keep the current behavior and clarify in the warning message that current behavior (default 'Tracker' name) is deprecated
* In 6 months: don't generate any default name; or replace default 'Tracker' name with the device name (but probably still display a warning)


#### 2013-06-13, 20:24:46 - Gabor Fichtinger
Sounds very reasonable.

## #778 When sending a command over OpenIGTLink to Plus server, it is handled multiple times
I send a start volume reconstruction command to plus server with the config: PlusConfiguration_OpenIGTLinkCommandsTest.xml and when the start command is sent, it is started multiple times.

@lassoan @ungi Do you know who implemented this part?

#### 2013-06-21, 01:44:17 - Andras Lasso
This is not a bug, but a feature. It is implemented so to allow running multiple commands in parallel in one single thread: active commands are stored in a queue and executed with a round-robin scheduling. Short commands (e.g., start/stop acquisition) are completed immediately and they are removed from the queue. Commands that take long time to complete (e.g., volume reconstruction, that runs in the background) is kept in the queue for an extended period of time and its execute method is called many times (until it reports that there is nothing else to do).

Now that we have devices that can do continuous processing in the background, I think this scheduler design is not necessary anymore (we can expect that all commands are completed in a very short time, so there would be only one active command at a time). All the commands already control devices only, except the volume reconstruction, so before retiring the command scheduler we would need to implement a volume reconstructor device. See details in #739.

Probably we can consider this ticket to be a duplicate of #739.

## #780 Add visualization of line segmentation results to fCal
Live update of segmentation results to see if the line can be segmented. Perhaps similar to segmentation parameter dialog? Or maybe make seg dialog do both jobs?

#### 2013-06-25, 12:53:58 - Andras Lasso
If we can save development and maintenance time then it's a good idea to add it to the existing dialog. For the line detection we only need the clip rectangle setting. If we use it in the future for single wall calibration as well then there might be additional few parameters to set.

## #785 Add outlier rejection to stylus calibration
Brainlab stylus with two reflective balls sometimes gives incorrect positions (due to stray reflections from other objects and the heuristics in determining the tip orientation). In the current pivot calibration algorithm even one outlier can significantly deteriorate the calibration result. Implement an outlier rejection mechanism in the stylus calibration to avoid this.

The outlier rejection can work similarly to the spatial calibration algo: compute the stdev of error, remove points where the error larger than stdev*f (where f=2.0 or so), repeat until no more points to remove.

#### 2013-12-05, 23:02:06 - Andras Lasso
(In r:3015|plus:3015) fixed #785: Added outlier rejection to stylus calibration. Stylus calibration is now performed using the robust LSQR minimizer.

## #791 Make the initialization of PhidgetSpatial tracker faster
Currently, the OrientationSensor and FilteredTiltSensor tools in the PhidgetSpatial tracker require a couple of seconds (or more, depending on the gain value) to converge from the initial orientation to the current orientation. To avoid this artifact, when the first measurement is obtained from the sensor, that measurement data should be used to update the sensor fusion algorithm many times, making that converging to the orientation that corresponds to the current position. This initialization technique is implemented in the SpatialSensorFusion application, so it could be taken from there.


## #792 Model path is hardcoded in Lego phantom config file 
There is a hardcoded path in the PlusLib\\data\\ConfigFiles\\PlusConfiguration_Sonix_Ascension_LegoPhantom.xml config file:

<!-- TODO: make sure the File attribute of the following DisplayableObject has the correct path -->
    <DisplayableObject Id='PhantomModel' Type='Model' ObjectCoordinateFrame='Phantom'
      Opacity='0.6'
      File='c:\\devel\\PlusBuild-bin\\PlusLib\\data\\CADModels\\LegoPhantom\\LegoPhantom.stl'
...
    />

If a model file is stored in the ModelDirectory (specified in the PlusConfig.xml file) then it's enough to include the model's filename in the config file.

You've done a great job, Adam. There are just a few remaining issues:
* 2D image in fCal is not updating (in the segmentation parameter dialog it works)
* in PlusVideoFrame saving is implemented with VTK, while ReadImageFromFile uses ITK. As 2D image IO classes in ITK and VTK use different image orientations, we cannot mix these. As we mostly use VTK now, I think it would be better to always use VTK image IO classes.
* in PlusVideoFrame the get oriented image method always creates a new vtkImageData object, then pixels are copied, and the object is deleted (causing memory fragmentation and performance degradation) - I'll commit a fix for this soon

re #793: Fixed memory reallocation issue (memory was reallocated and copied for each acquired frame). Cleaned up iamge extent to image size conversion. Added Modified() calls where pixel data was updated with direct buffer address (e.g., memcpy) to fix image update issue in fCal application GUI.
Commit: r:3177|plus:3177

#### 2014-02-21, 01:14:39 - Andras Lasso
I've committed fixes for the frame reallocation and fCal update issues (the update problem were due to that only the pixel data changed in the vtkImageData object but the modified time didn't, so the renderer thought that nothing changed, so did not update the screen).
So, the only remaining issue is the image IO classes inconsistency. It would be great if you could replace the ITK IO classes by VTK IO classes in PlusVideoFrame.

According to Coordinate_system_definitions the unit of both _Probe_ and _Reference_ coordinate systems are in mm.
According to Transformation_matrix_definition the unit of the translation component is the unit of the _To_ coordinate system (here: _Reference_ coordinate system).
Therefore, the unit of the translation values in the ProbeToReferenceTransform is mm.

Hi Andras,

I had already seen that and I assume that these values are in mm as well, yesterday I acquired a sequence of tracked US, the probe to reference translation (p_t*inv(r_t)) does not make sense if the values are in mm. I’ve acquired this sequence while making the probe far from the reference by the step of 2 cm approximately. Look at the p_r translations I've calculated, besides I've done the temporal calibration beforehand as well. 

p_r1 = [-0.2130   -0.9769    0.0196  775.4472   -0.8595    0.1968    0.4718  489.6373  -0.4647    0.0836   -0.8815  485.0092    0         0         0    1.0000 ]

Maybe you mixed up the wires and another sensor was plugged in that port. It's hard to notice if you have another reference accidentally, because spare sensors lie around statically, so the system basically works with any reference that doesn't move. They are just far.

#### 2013-07-12, 15:04:13 - Andras Lasso
Amir, please read again the pages that I referenced above. Points should be multiplied from the right.

#### 2013-07-12, 15:54:27 - Amir Khojaste
Hi Andras, 

What do you mean? I meant the translation part of ProbeToReference does not make sense. The points should be multiplied from right definitely, if we multiply them from left we’ll get a 4x4 matrix not a point. Thanks


#### 2013-07-12, 16:52:36 - Tamas Ungi
I think it should be ( inv(r_t) * p_t ) in matlab style. Because that will result Probe->Tracker => Tracker->Reference; that gives Probe->Reference.

#### 2013-07-12, 17:49:12 - Amir Khojaste
Alright. I see. Thanks Tamas

#### 2013-07-12, 18:04:38 - Andras Lasso
Please use the naming convention specified in http://perk.cs.queensu.ca/sites/perk.cs.queensu.ca/files/WritingCorrectAndUnderstandableCode.pptx. Then it's almost impossible to make errors with combining transforms. Naming variables p_t and r_t are unnacceptable. I've mistaken your p_t*inv(r_t) expression by multiplying a point by a matrix from the right.

#### 2013-07-12, 18:13:55 - Amir Khojaste
Actually I just used them as a sign to clarify what I did and they are not the names I used for transformation, but thanks for the information nonetheless. 

#### 2013-07-12, 18:42:32 - Andras Lasso
OK. Use the same naming convention in the source code, documentation, and all communication to avoid misunderstandings and save everybody's time.

#### 2013-07-25, 22:56:06 - Andras Lasso
By the way, in practice you shouldn't have the same tool name ('from' coordinate system) for two different trackers. If you track the same object using two different trackers, then you'll track two different coordinate systems (as they are defined by the tracker-specific marker or sensor mounted on the object).

Anyway, it's nice if using the same tool names for different trackers is allowed, because there is a theoretical possibility that someone will need it in the future (e.g., if the same marker is tracked by two optical trackers).

Attempting to find a solution that doesnt' change the repo structure, only the download command.

#### 2013-08-06, 13:45:15 - Adam Rankin
@lassoan an alternative I see is to place the data in another root directory called PlusData (or something) and have that as an external project that downloads to the pluslib/data/testimages directory...

thoughts?

#### 2013-08-06, 13:49:06 - Adam Rankin
The downside to the PlusData approach is that the location of the folder would be another cmake variable who's path would have to match the repo structure.

With the first approach, the path could be embedded in the CMake file as part of the command.

I can't visualize a way around manually entering the path in a variable or file...

#### 2013-08-06, 15:06:21 - Andras Lasso
It's important that src and data directories are kept consistent (for a specific version of the source code there is matching version of the test data).
At some point, there was no common root directory of the src and data directories, but it was very difficult to keep the data and source consistent.

I see two options:
* Option A: Keep the directory structure as is, just review the files and move the non-essential ones elsewhere and reduce the size of the rest.
* Option B: Use the CMake ExternalData method (http://www.kitware.com/source/home/post/107), preferably with an SVN repository.

#### 2013-08-06, 15:20:20 - Andras Lasso
For me, this is a low priority item (I'm not fully convinced that we really need this), as it makes Plus build somewhat more convenient for users who don't want to run tests (do we want to help this practice??), but makes the build system more complex for everybody.

#### 2013-08-06, 17:37:08 - Tamas Ungi
Right now, when PLUS users (who build their own PLUS) ask me about how to set up IGT systems, it's so good that I can send them simple instructions using a config file and a saved example data from the PLUS repo (already on their computer). They can effortlessly start a tracked ultrasound simulator. I'm sorry to hear that the example data will not be part of PLUS, as it will be a lot more complicated to show them how PLUS works on their computer.


#### 2013-08-06, 20:46:18 - Adam Rankin
@ungi If we end up doing this change, nothing will change for users. The option would be enabled by default and advanced users could elect not to download the test data.

Essentially nothing would change to the user except if you didn't want to download 430MB of test/example data, you don't have to.

#### 2013-08-06, 20:46:54 - Adam Rankin

## #805 Set vtkPhantomLandmarkRegistrationAlgo explicite as RigidBody, not Similarity transform
In file vtkPhantomLandmarkRegistrationAlgo.cxx, line 85 looks like follow:
 


~~~~

itk::Similarity3DTransform<double>::Pointer transform = itk::Similarity3DTransform<double>::New();


~~~~



This is an object for landmark based transform of the fCal phantom. But in the class itk::LandmarkBasedTransformInitializer, there is information, that 'Currently, the  following transforms are supported by the class: VersorRigid3DTransform,  Rigid2DTransform'. As Similarity3DTransform inherits VersorRigid3DTransform, there is no compilation or runtime error, but the transformation is not a Similarity transform (there is no scaling). There is the same issue in the class vtkPhantomLinearObjectRegistrationAlgo, maybe also in other classes?



#### 2013-08-06, 15:55:38 - Andras Lasso
Thank you, it's a good catch. There is no need for scaling for the phantom registration and the according to the documentation we may use a sub-optimal transform, so VersorRigid3DTransform would be more appropriate, indeed.

## #806 PlusServerRemoteControl tool doesn't receive reply from the server
Following the example on the PlusServer_commands page, started the server
PlusServer.exe --config-file=..\\..\\PlusLib\\data\\ConfigFiles\  esting\\PlusConfiguration_OpenIGTLinkCommandsTest.xml

## #807 Whitespace at the end of file name causes error
This is an example part of a config file. If I delete the space at the end of the file name, it works. It doesn't find the file like this:

<Device
      Id='TrackedVideoDevice'
      Type='SavedDataSource'
      SequenceMetafile='s:\\images\\Spine\\phantom\\Scoliosis\\2013-07-18_AdultScoliosisVolume\\AdultScoliosis-T3.mha '
      UseData='IMAGE_AND_TRANSFORM'

#### 2013-09-17, 05:30:38 - Andras Lasso
Yes, if you enter any extra character anywhere in a filename then the file will not be found. We could add an exception for whitespaces at the and end of filenames, because most (not all) Windows program and APIs truncate the  space at the end of the filenames, but it's not the case for Linux/Mac.

I would rather not introduce OS-specific heuristics to fix an issue due to such a trivial user error. However, if you think that the error/warning messages were not helpful enough to detect the user error then let me know and we should be able to improve the messages.

## #812 EM tracker quality signal (Ascension trakSTAR )
Is it possible to also read and pass the Q (quality signal) along with the transformation matrix?

#### 2013-10-10, 20:10:57 - Andras Lasso
This would be a new feature. We can create a new 'virtual tool' for this and store the Q in the translation component of the transformation matrix.

I guess it's the (USHORT quality) value that is returned along with the pose data (s:\\data\\lab.hardware\\Ascension\\3DGuidance_trakSTAR_Installation_and_Operation_Guide.pdf).

When would you need this by?

#### 2013-10-10, 21:24:49 - Hossein Sadjadi
Thanks Andras, 
I always used the Ascension software to save the data and their standard output format is: [status x, y, z, azimuth, elevation, roll, button, quality, time]
The quality Q (AKA, signal quality, quality number, or metal number), is an integer (I think 4 bytes) that somehow represent measurement uncertainty which I need to store it's value. 

I plan to perform my experiments in around a week from now. If this can be incorporated into Plus by then, it would be great, otherwise I still would need this for my other set of experiments that I'll be running later on this term (not sure about its time yet).

The feature is complete, it is ready for testing - e.g., capture data using fCal, with the PlusConfiguration_SensorFusion_Ascension3DG.xml config file.

Quality values are returned in the Quality matrix. Quality values the first 0-2 sensors are in the translation part of the matrix. Quality values for the 3-5 sensors are in the diagonal of the rotation part of the matrix.

With this development completed, PlusServer can send the transforms and quality values to clients through OpenIGTLink. Need to implement an OpenIGTLink receiver in Matlab - see #832.

#### 2013-10-27, 20:04:13 - Andras Lasso
@rankin: Do you change the offset of the fixed signal as well?
Probably the best would be to only modify the moving signal's offset so that we can calibrate all devices by multiple pairwise calibrations (for this we would need to keep the fixed signal's offset unchanged and only modify the moving signal's offset).

#### 2013-10-29, 17:21:15 - Adam Rankin
Yes, I set the fixed offset to 0.

#### 2013-10-29, 17:21:52 - Adam Rankin
Multiple pairwise offsets only make sense if the fixed signal source is always the same? Therefore it should always be the 0 offset?

#### 2013-10-29, 19:43:40 - Andras Lasso
Unfortunately, the fixed signal's offset should be kept unchanged to allow 'chained' pairwise temporal calibration.
e.g., we have A, B, C, D devices, we should be able to determine the offsets by doing these 3 calibrations: A->B, A->C, C->D; when we perform the C->D calibration we shouldn't modify C's offset, because it would erase the A->C calibration

#### 2013-12-20, 15:20:24 - Andras Lasso
From code review it seems that a few things are still not perfect:
* Fixed device's time offset should never be changed at all (currently I think it is set to 0 and not restored)
* Moving device's time offset should not be changed before the calibration: it'll be a new behavior, but it's good because then the 'before calibration' diagram will show how good the calibration was with the previously computed temporal calibration applied => a very good verification that the offset is correct and it is applied correctly (sign is OK, ...)
* Only change the moving device's time offset at the end of a successful temporal calibration (just something like this->MovingChannel->GetOwnerDevice()->SetLocalTimeOffsetSec(this->MovingChannel->GetOwnerDevice()->GetLocalTimeOffsetSec()+trackerLagSec); or this->MovingChannel->GetOwnerDevice()->SetLocalTimeOffsetSec(this->MovingChannel->GetOwnerDevice()->GetLocalTimeOffsetSec()-trackerLagSec);)

Unfortunately, the temporal calibration result doesn't seem to be applied correctly. If the temporal calibration result is correctly applied then:
* moving device's local time offset will oscillate around the same value after multiple temporal calibrations
* if you add 0.5sec to the fixed device's local time offset and perform temporal calibration then the moving device's local time offset should increase by 0.5sec, too

Next steps: Performance could be improved. Beamwidth and specular reflection is not yet included in the model.

## #822 QVariant::asString -> toString
 `QVariant::asString` is only available in Qt 4 when Qt is built with the Qt3 compatibility layer:

http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.7/qt4-intro.html#id-92ae81c6-b3eb-4f76-9250-cd7b41c36e8a

My understanding was that PLUS requires Qt 4.7.4 at minimum, which does not include this function by default.
http://harmattan-dev.nokia.com/docs/library/html/qt4/qvariant.html

Alternatively, perhaps the PLUS build instructions should mention the qt3support requirement?

(note that the Qt3 layer has been removed in Qt5)

Ah, PLUS requires exactly 4.7.4. The newer releases of Qt aren't supported.

#### 2013-11-20, 17:19:53 - Andras Lasso
If there is a solution that is compatible with both the officially supported Qt 4.7.4 and with newer Qt versions then it would be nice do that.
This way when the Qt version is changed in Slicer (and Plus always follows the officially Qt version used by Slicer) then there is a chance that everything will just work.

## #824 Separate UI and data collector into different threads
Currently the UI and data collector occupy the same thread. A better user experience can be had by decoupling the two elements.

A solution could be to launch the data collector from the UI thread, and have this launched thread behave as a master thread for the data collector.

This might create some issues with synchronization, but the UI should be behaving in a polling mode, so any polling functions should be made thread-safe anyways.

#### 2013-11-25, 16:31:18 - Andras Lasso
Note that some devices (those that provide a callback function) have to call the device SDK from the main thread. Also, some devices require processing of the message queue (PeekMessage/TranslateMessage/DispatchMessage).
So, probably the data collector still has to be at least initialized and stopped from the main thread and the main thread may have to call a DataCollector::ProcessPendingMessages method regularly (to give the DataCollector and devices a chance to run some functions from the main thread).

re #826: Fixed clip rectangle definition in CreateSliceModels (when nothing is specified the full frame size is used)
Commit: r:4136|plus:4136


## #827 Allow user to specify frame size with generic Windows framegrabber device
Concerning VfW it is not possible to set the resolution manually, which is in fact a problem, when the video device supports several resolutions.
As Adam told me, plus asks the device for the resolution and sets it accordingly. If the frame grabber now supports several resolutions this may be a huge problem, because plus gets a list (I guess so) of several resolutions supported. Plus now (again a guess) selects the first of the list and configures the device to that resolution.

The resolution set in my actual case is 320x240 which is far to low to get a reasonable picturequality and there is no way to force such driver settings. Not only that the resolution is that low, the US-Image is only a rectangle of about 130x130 pixel. In most cases where a Webcam is used this is not such a problem, as they only support one resolution, but for video cards this can be a problem as mentioned.
So it would be great to implement such a setting in the Plus configuration for VfW.

Thanks, Reinhard

There are many options that can be configured for an imaging device, so it would be hard to pick a few ones that Plus would specifically control. Plus just uses the settings that you've configured for your device (does not do anything like selecting a first option from a list).

Configure the resolution, bit depth, compression, color mode, etc. parameters in the software that comes with your framegrabber.
You can also use the following Plus tool to change the settings:
vtkWin32VideoSourceTest.exe --show-dialogs

Let me know if it works for you and then I'll update the documentation accordingly.

If you don't like the solution described above then we can implement setting some parameters from the config file as well (such as the frame size, if this is the only parameter that you would like to customize).

CreateDefaultOutputChannel is not only for testing. It's useful whenever we want to let the device to define its own output channel(s). We might decide in the future to not require setting the output channels explicitly in the config files, then this function would be used for creating the output channel(s). Explicit output channel specification has advantages (simpler config file) but also disadvantages (not clear from the config file what output channels are available and with what content), so for now we keep things as is.

## #829 PlusServer sends StylusToTracker transform when Reference unavailable
Using the NDI Polaris with a Stylus sensor and a Reference sensor, I want to send the StylusTipToReference sensor to Slicer. Everything works until I block the line of sight to one of the sensors with my hand. If I put my hand in front of the Stylus sensor, the transform stops updating (which is good). If I put my hand in front of the Reference sensor, I get what appears to be the StylusTipToTracker transform (but I would like it to just stop updating the StylusTipToReference transform).

I created an identity transform ReferenceToTest in the config file and sent the StylusTipToTest transform with the PlusServer. There was no change in behaviour.

I tried this using the latest download available (PlusApp_2.0.0.2873) and with one of the other binaries (PlusApp_2.1.0.2971).

#### 2013-12-02, 17:00:44 - Andras Lasso

## #830 Status of inverted transforms are not updated in the transform repository
When updating an non-inverted transform (such as ReferenceToTracker) in the transform repository, the inverted transform (such as TrackerToReference) status is not updated in the repository.

If ReferenceToTracker status is invalid on startup => TrackerToReference transform status will remain invalid for the whole execution time of the application, even if the reference sensor gets in the view.
If ReferenceToTracker status is valid on startup => TrackerToReference (and therefore StylusToReference) transform status will remain valid, even if the reference sensor is out of view.

## #831 Loaded temporal calibration results are not shown on GUI
When we load a configuration file to the fCal, the temporal calibration box in the gui does not show the calibration result we already got. 
I wonder when we redo only the spatial calibration, the temporal calibration that we have in the configuration file is applied although the temporal calibration is not shown in the box of the GUI.


#### 2013-12-06, 20:37:48 - Andras Lasso
Example:
On the GUI: Temporal calibration is 0.0ms.
In the log:
* Device local time offset for VideoDevice: 0ms
* Device local time offset for TrackedVideoDevice: 249.455ms

The correct solution would be to show the difference between the local time offsets on the GUI.

#### 2013-12-06, 21:46:29 - Adam Rankin
I can create a GUI that has two drop down boxes, and based on which devices you choose will show the relative offset between them?

#### 2013-12-06, 21:46:51 - Adam Rankin
Also is that with the latest PLUS, because it shouldn't be assigning the local time offset to the virtual devices anymore.

#### 2013-12-20, 04:43:23 - Andras Lasso
Minor GUI tuning:
1. Moving (offset=x) => would be better to show the actual offset value the same way as for the Fixed (offset=0.0234s)
2. Add 's' after the offset value: (offset=0.1234s)
3. If no transform is chosen for a tracking output then disable the start button or abort the temporal calibration immediately immediately after clicking on Start (now it looks as if it computes something, progress bar is moving, etc. and only fails at the end)

## #835 OpenIGTLink TDATA bugs
There are a couple issues in the OpenIGTLink TDATA support in current trunk. I have a patch that I plan to commit referencing this issue, after testing against real BrainLab.

- need to unpack header in InternalUpdate before checking the DeviceType
- need to use full transform name for TimeStampedUpdate

#### 2013-12-09, 22:51:45 - Andras Lasso
Great, the patch is welcome. Let me know if we can help with code review or testing.

#### 2013-12-12, 18:02:01 - Andras Lasso
We would like to release a new stable version next week. Do you think you can provide your patch by then?

#### 2013-12-12, 19:19:56 - Isaiah Norton
Thanks for the heads-up. Yes, at least to restore basic TDATA functionality. The simulator works fine with the patch.

I did some testing with the clinical system earlier in the week, and found that with the patch, the TDATA connection opens correctly and data is received for a short time. Unfortunately, somewhere in the changes from r2985 on, the timeouts are now too aggressive, and PLUS tries to reconnect seemingly every time there is a missed tracking message. On the clinical system we must manually accept each connection, so it becomes a problem when 100 reconnects are sent in succession (the resulting behavior of the target system is 'undesirable'..). I will look for a solution tomorrow when I have access to the room.

#### 2013-12-12, 19:29:32 - Andras Lasso
There should be no reconnects at all when ReconnectOnReceiveTimeout='false' is set for the tracker Device element in the config file. Maybe you could check that.

## #840 Check Windows SDK requirement if MMF video is enabled
If MMF video option is enabled and no recent Windows SDK is installed then Plus build fails with

9>2>..\\..\\..\\..\\PlusLib\\src\\Utilities\\MfVideoCaptureLibrary\\FormatReader.cpp(307) : error C2065: 'MF_MT_FRAME_RATE_RANGE_MAX' : undeclared identifier
9>2>..\\..\\..\\..\\PlusLib\\src\\Utilities\\MfVideoCaptureLibrary\\FormatReader.cpp(318) : error C2065: 'MF_MT_FRAME_RATE_RANGE_MIN' : undeclared identifier
9>2>..\\..\\..\\..\\PlusLib\\src\\Utilities\\MfVideoCaptureLibrary\\FormatReader.cpp(381) : error C2065: 'MF_MT_AAC_PAYLOAD_TYPE' : undeclared identifier

This is not very informative for the developer.

We should add a try-compile test that checks the existence of these constants and prints a detailed error message at configuration time (that explains what SDK has to be installed).

(In r:3070|plus:3070) re #840: Fixed Windows SDK detection

The FindWindowsSDK.cmake in Utilities caused build error with VS2008, as it returned the wrong SDK version (6.1). The issue is this find macro can only return the CURRENT version or a specific version. So, just keep using the FindWindowsSDK.cmake that is already in PlusBuild and works better (can return the LATEST SDK version).

Removed SDK detection error check, because it did not work (did not print an error when the wrong SDK was used, the build failed at the unspecified constant in an FormatReader.cpp). The problem is that when multiple SDKs are detected it's not enough to check if 7.1 is detected but it should be checked what is actually used. Moreover, any SDK version >7.1 should be accepted, too, so this check actually prevents some correct configuration from building. Implementing a correct solution would be difficult, so removed this check and just added a comment in FormatReader.cpp where the error occurs that SDK 7.1 or more recent has to be installed (it's in the build instructions, too).

Moved required MF link libraries to the MfVideoCaptureLibrary.


#### 2013-12-18, 14:15:30 - Andras Lasso
What is still missing is a check that the latest found SDK version is at least 7.1 (but accept anything that >7.1, too). This is only a convenience function for developers, so not essential for this release.

## #841 Change video resolution definition tag in ICCapturing
In all other framegrabber video sources FrameSize and VideoFormat are two separate attributes, while ICCapturing combines them in one (VideoFormat='Y800 (640x480)').

## #843 MMF video device is not usable after reconnect
If SafeRelease(&this->CaptureSourceReader); is called in vtkMmfVideoSource::InternalDisconnect() then the process crashes (with some stack corruption? it seems that it makes some bogus vtkPlusDevice destructor to be called).

If SafeRelease(&this->CaptureSourceReader); is called in vtkMmfVideoSource::InternalDisconnect() then there is no crash, but video is not captured on the next Connect().

(In r:3083|plus:3083) re #843: Commented out SafeRelease(&this->CaptureSourceReader); in disconnect to prevent crash. Added locking to serialize MF access, but in itself it is not enough to avoid the crash.

#### 2013-12-20, 02:24:53 - Andras Lasso
The crash is reproducible with 
vtkMmfVideoSourceTest.exe --frame-size 640 480 --rendering-off
in release mode (when the release is not commented out in the disconnect).

Interestingly, these don't crash:
vtkMmfVideoSourceTest.exe --frame-size 640 480
vtkMmfVideoSourceTest.exe --rendering-off

## #844 Auto-detect landmark points during phantom registration
During the phantom registration the user has to mark 8 landmark points: for each point he should place the sylustip into the landmark point and click a button or press the foot pedal. 

We could implement point auto-detection: instead of requiring the user to click a button or press the foot pedal, the user could simply pivot the needle for a few seconds (while keeping the tip at a landmark point) to signal that a landmark point is touched.

The changes look good. Please also add doxygen and dot detection at PlusBuild level. That would allow:
1. Reporting error to the user immediately (when configuring the project) if doxygen or dot is not installed/not found
2. Verifying/modifying the default doxygen and doth paths.

No modifications should be needed in PlusLib and PlusApp. Should be enough to just send the paths to PlusLib external project.

It looks OK.
* Maybe move the Supported platforms before installation (Supported hardware devices, Supported platforms, Installation, Configuration settings, ...)
* Add the list of supported platforms
* For installation write how to install the device: Do you need to install any drivers? If yes, where those drivers are available? Mention the GrabberLocation
* Instead of having the 'Color image acquisition is supported' comment maybe describe how you can actually configure color image acquisition (see PlusDeviceSet_Server_EpiphanColorVideoCapture.xml example)
* Create a page for common imaging devices attributes (PortUsImageOrientation, ImageType, etc.) and add a link to that page
* Create a page for common device attributes (AcquisitionRate, BufferSize, AveragedItemsForFiltering, etc.) and add a link to that page

I confirm that it builds fine on x64 by partially removing the ImageGrabber functionality from the library. I think we should remove this completely as we don't use the ImageGrabber functionality and it would reduce the maintenance overhead.

Could you please remove ImageGrabber, ImageGrabberThread, and RawImage classes?
(and the GetRawImageOut and IsFrameNew methods and other small things that may refer to them in the MediaFoundationVideoDevice and MediaFoundationVideoCaptureApi)

Sorry I was not clear. I confirm that it builds fine on x64.

You've removed some of the ImageGrabber functionality, but actually we don't need the ImageGrabber at all (the Plus device performs the tasks). So, I suggested to remove the whole ImageGrabber feature from the lib.

## #851 Issues connecting to medSAFE tracker when both 3DG and 3DGm are enabled
With both 3DG and 3DGm enabled, trying to connect to 3DGm leads to this error:

|ERROR|1703.785000| Board # 0: Time out before response from target
board |in c:\\andrey\\plusbuild-win32-bin\\pluslib\\src\\datacollection\\ascension3dgtracking\\vtkAscension3DGTrackerBase.cxx(457)

c:\\andrey\\plusbuild-win32-bin\\pluslib\\src\\datacollection\\ascension3dgtracking\\vtkAscension3DGTrackerBase.cxx(457)

 The symbols exported by ATC3DG.dll and ATC3DGm.dll appear to have the same signatures. Both libraries are linked when 3DGm is used. I think what I was seeing was caused by 3DG libraries being used. To verify this hypothesis, I deleted ATC3DG.dll and copied 3DGm to 3DG. After this I was able to connect to the tracker.

from @lassoan: need to test if it works correctly when you enable PLUS_USE_Ascension3DGm and disable PLUS_USE_Ascension3D.

#### 2014-01-15, 13:27:34 - Andrey Fedorov
I checked with a clean build, when compiled with only 3DGm enabled, 3DG libraries are not copied to the binary directory, so there should be no problem.

## #852 Unproper outliers detection
Hello,

During pivot point calculation in GetPivotPointPosition function (vtkPivotCalibrationAlgo.cxx) each measured point (or better: each transformation matrix MarkerToReference) is represented by three consecutive rows in the matrix. But inside RemoveOutliersFromLSRQ (PlusMath.cxx, by the way, is there a typo?) all rows are treated independently. 

So it might happened then, if we had one 'almost outlier point', only one or two rows would be removed from processing, while the algorithm should remove all three points. I know, with most ouliers all three rows will be removed, but at least because of the performance it would be good idea to process rows by three. 

I attach here the proposal of fix (new lines are 269-306 instead of original 269-299). I am git-oriented man and I don't know how to create a pull request with svn. Probably my soulution is wrong because the function LSQRMinimize is used by different algorithms.

Regards,
Bartłomiej

Thanks for looking into this and proposing a modification. You are right that PlusMath::LSQRMinimize is a generic LSQR solver and it removes outliers for each coordinate axis separately and I agree that most cases when one component of a transform is corrupted then probably all the other components are corrupted, too, so we could decide to remove a sample entirely if we find any discrepancy in any of its components.

However, it may be possible that rejecting only the faulty component is the right thing to do (e.g., when there is an intermittent flip in the transform) and we should not reject the whole transform. Also, when a component of a sample is not an outlier, it can only influence the results very slightly (if the percentage of outliers is below a few percent then I'm sure that the difference is not measurable).

As the implementation in PlusMath::LSQRMinimize is generic, I cannot change it as you suggested. I could add a post-processing step in vtkPivotCalibrationAlgo, but it would mean some extra code to write, test, and maintain and I'm not even sure if there is any practical benefit (or even in theory we would do better). Let me know if you see this differently, I'm open to reconsider this if you can show that the current behavior is bad.

(In r:3133|plus:3133) re #852: Fixed typo and added more information about the outlier rejection in the pivot calibration algorithm

#### 2014-01-20, 21:19:37 - Bart??omiej Pyci??ski
I agree that the results are probably very similiar, regardless of this modification. Although I am pretty sure that current behaviour with leaving some rows is not mathematicaly correct, I don't think that implementing the modifications is necessary for correct job. For example if there was 100 pints, let's say there was 6 outliers, 4 of them were 'full' and 2 'partially', then there would be 2-4 false rows against 284-286 correct. 1.4%, it might look pretty much, but don't forget that these values are not recorded from real ouliers, but the boundary one, so the difference should be even smaller.

I mainly wanted to point out that inside the source there had been no information, if this was intentional, or by mistake. If there will be a necessity to implement modifications, I think the easiest solution is to add another funcion to PlusMath.

Unfortunately I don't have presently posibilities to compare results with sample data. I think you can close the thicket if there are no other voices in the discussion

Bart.

## #854 Add support for BK 8862/8863 probes
We have used the attached patch to add support for several additional BK probes (so far used with 8862 probe to acquire RF data during one neurosurgery case).
This issue is to request review and advice. In particular there are two points which would break support for the prostate probe:

L44: there is only one channel available (also for 8863 and 8820e probes)

* Should I add a configuration option to make this check contingent on a configured number of channels?

L57: the modelID field != 0 for at least the 8862

* Not sure what to do about this.

Thank you.

## #858 Create PlusServer launching service
Currently PlusServer has to be started manually on the data collection computer, which may be inconvenient. We could develop a simple always-running application that can start (and stop) a PlusServer with a chosen configuration file requested through an OpenIGTLink command.

The config file could be a locally stored file (then the filename would be defined in the OpenIGTLink command) or the XML string could be sent in the OpenIGTLink command.

The service could start with Windows. The service could be added to the startup menu by the installer (with the same shortcut name, to avoid having multiple servers started).

It should be able to start PlusServer with a specific config and also kill the process.

Probably the simplest implementation would be to add an OpenIGTLink listener socket to PlusServerLauncher.

## #861 Allow definition of origin for scan conversion
Currently the image origin for scan conversion is the top/left corner for linear transducers and x-mm-from-bottom/center for curvilinear transducers, this has to be made configurable by adding TransducerCenterPixel[2] parameter that defines the centerpoint of the transducer in the MF coordinate system.
The TransducerCenter is the position of the center transducer element on the transducer surface (this is consistent with how BrainLab and Ultrasonix defines the probe position).

Make the OutputImageStartDepthMm attribute obsolete (remove from documentation; in the code use it only if the new attribute is not defined).

There is no clipping of the right side of the capture control, so that's good. But the horizontal scrollbar is still there. Can we get rid of that?

#### 2014-03-06, 02:33:55 - Adam Rankin

If so I think that happens to all toolboxes? I can fix that as well if you want.

It only happens with the Capturing tab.

By the way, if I start fCal and switch to Capturing and then to Configuraiton tab then fCal crashes. Could you fix this, too?

Re #869 Some values that were hard-coded are now variables of the class vtkIntersonVideoSource.cxx. A method was added in order to know which one are the allowed modes for the probe. The implementation of this method is not nice and will be changed in the future. Also was added a method to set the depth of the probe. If the requested depth is not allowed, the first one of the allowed methods is chosen. The probe that we are using seems to have only two available modes: a) 10cm, 3.75 MHz b) 15 cm, 3.75 MHz.

@GuillermoCarbajal Thanks, this ppt is very useful! We are planning to merge the vtkIntersonVideoSource (that we use with the older probes) and vtkIntersonSDKCxxVideoSource (that uses the new SDK) classes. This would mean many changes in both classes. Do you have any pending changes that you would like commit before this big code reorganization?

#### 2014-06-10, 17:07:25 - GuillermoCarbajal
It's great that you will give full support for the Interson probes. Hopefully in the future we will be one of the users! I have no pending commits so feel free to change whatever you want.
Cheers,
Guillermo

## #870 Some DLLs has to be updated when using Plus with MicronTracker 3.7.2
Error when building Plus:
CMake Error at src/DataCollection/CMakeLists.txt:786 (FILE):file COPY cannot find 'c:/Program Files/Claron Technology/MicronTracker/Windist/digiclops.dll'.

The new MicronTracker SDK only uses FlyCapture and not Digiclops. As seen url:http://www.ptgrey.com/support/kb/index.asp?a=4&q=262|here, the new Micron Tracker model using the Bumblee XB3 is not compatible with Digiclops and newer versions of the MicronTracker SDK do not include it. Older cameras may still require Digiclops. Might be best to add a CMake option for MicronTracker SDK version.


Update:
Was successful building Plus with the following steps:
1. Install the Micron Tracker 3.7.2.3 software (64-bit or 32-bit)
2. Install Flycapture 2.5.3.4 (64-bit or 32-bit) selecting 'I will use firewire cameras.' (an earlier version of FlyCapture 2 may work, but this is what I used)
3. Copy the FlyCapture2.dll and FlyCapture2_C.dll from the Program Files\\Point Grey Research\\FlyCapture2\\bin64 folder to Program Files\\Claron Technology\\MicronTracker and Program Files\\Point Grey Research\\FlyCapture2\\bin64 folder to Program Files\\Claron Technology\\MicronTracker\\Dist (and wherever else to replace the existing FlyCapture2.dll and FlyCapture2_C.dll if the application needs it)
3. Copy PGRFlyCapture.dll from the Program Files\\Point Grey Research\\FlyCapture2\\bin64\\FC1 folder to Program Files\\Claron Technology\\MicronTracker, Program Files\\Claron Technology\\MicronTracker\\Dist, and Program Files\\Claron Technology\\MicronTracker\\Dist\\Windist (and wherever else to replace the existing PGRFlyCapture.dll if the application needs it)
4. Copy digiclops.dl and triclops.dll from Program Files\\Claron Technology\\MicronTracker\\Dist to Program Files\\Claron Technology\\MicronTracker\\Dist\\Windist
5. Copy MTVideo.h from Program Files\\Claron Technology\\MicronTracker\\MTDemoCPP to Program Files\\Claron Technology\\MicronTracker\\Dist
6. Build 32-bit Plus

However, Plus still fails to recognize the camera with a 'Failed to attach cameras using calibration data' error showing.

Plus also does not copy Flycapture2.dll and FlyCapture2_C.dll.

Works correctly when installed with the following procedure (might not all be necessary, but it's the exact procedure which led to it working):

Was successful building Plus with the following steps:
1. Install Flycapture 2.5.3.4 (64-bit or 32-bit) first selecting 'I will use firewire cameras.'
2. Restart the computer
3. Run \\'Program Files\\Point Grey Research\\FlyCapture2\\bin64\\Point Grey FlyCap2.exe' and ensure that the camera is detected
4. Install the Micron Tracker 3.7.2.3 software (64-bit or 32-bit)
5. Copy the FlyCapture2.dll and FlyCapture2_C.dll from the Program Files\\Point Grey Research\\FlyCapture2\\bin64 folder to Program Files\\Claron Technology\\MicronTracker and Program Files\\Point Grey Research\\FlyCapture2\\bin64 folder to Program Files\\Claron Technology\\MicronTracker\\Dist (and wherever else to replace the existing FlyCapture2.dll and FlyCapture2_C.dll if the application needs it)

7. Copy digiclops.dl and triclops.dll from Program Files\\Claron Technology\\MicronTracker\\Dist to Program Files\\Claron Technology\\MicronTracker\\Dist\\Windist
8. Copy MTVideo.h from Program Files\\Claron Technology\\MicronTracker\\MTDemoCPP to Program Files\\Claron Technology\\MicronTracker\\Dist
9. Build 32-bit Plus
10. Copy the dll files to the Plus build
11. Uninstall the Micron Tracker software and Flycapture2
12. Install Flycapture 2.5.3.4 (64-bit or 32-bit) first selecting 'I will use firewire cameras.'
13. Restart the computer
14. Run \\'Program Files\\Point Grey Research\\FlyCapture2\\bin64\\Point Grey FlyCap2.exe' and ensure that the camera is detected
15. Install the Micron Tracker 3.7.2.3 software (64-bit or 32-bit)
16. Run Plus Server

Need to verify the steps on a new computer then simplify the steps (e.g., Plus should look for the SDK files where they are located; if the file location is different in different SDK versions, then do the lookup based on the SDK version - similarly to as it is done for Ultrasonix).

re #873: New directory that contains 2 modified files: PlusServerRemoteControl.cxx and vtkPlusOpenIGTLinkClient.cxx. These have been adapted such that: 
1. the OpenIGTLink client reads the tracking information sent by the PlusServer in a message of type TRANSFORM - see modifications brought to the file vtkPlusOpenIGTLinkClient.cxx;
2. the PlusServerRemoteControl client doesn't end its session after it runs its command, but rather loops indefinitely until an interruption even takes place - see modifications brought to the file PlusServerRemoteControl.cxx.

The purpose of these was to read for a indefinite period of time the tracking information sent by the PlusServer.

Thanks for your contribution. I've integrated the functionality into the existing PlusServerRemoteControl and vtkPlusOpenIGTLinkClient. To test it, run the PlusServerRemoteControl with the --keep-connected flag to activate the transform logging.
If you find that all the functionalities that you wanted are there in the updated clients then we'll remove the files from the sandbox.

Everything works as expected if I initialize the boolean flag keepConnected to 'false' instead of 'true' (see line 361, file PlusServerRemoteControl.cxx). Left as it is now(true), makes the client to loop infinitely, read and print the TRANSFORM messages, even though the --keep-connected flag is not used. I've noticed this behavior while running the client without any flag whatsoever - in this case, the statement


~~~~


 if ( command.empty() && !keepConnected)
  {
    LOG_ERROR('The program has nothing to do, as neither --command nor --keep-connected is specifed'); 
    std::cout << 'Help: ' << args.GetHelp() << std::endl;
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE); 
  }

does not behave as expected, i.e., it doesn't exit the program.

## #877 Build types (32-bit/64-bit/embedded) are not recognizable
If you install a 32-bit and a 64-bit version of PLUS, it is currently very hard to tell which item in the Start Menu corresponds to which build. If possible, it should be indicated in the start menu folders which build type is the installed PLUS.

## #878 Plus Server crashes when modifying path under config file
I connected to devices using PlusServer. While it was running, I changed the folder name of the config file that was used for the connection. When I pressed disconnect, Plus Server crashed. It probably should have gone back to a state where no config file is selected, and the folder selection should probably go back to some default folder.

## #882 Remove backward compatibility code
For a transition period, Plus is supported to be used with VTK5, VTK6 and VTK7. To reduce maintenance and testing overhead, VTK5 and VTK6 support should be removed.

The same applies to Qt4 support.

Remove VTK5/VTK6 backward-compatibility code:
* Search for VTK_VERSION_MAJOR in the PlusLib and PlusApp source code and remove all code that is in the VTK_VERSION_MAJOR<6 branch
* Remove SetInputData_vtk5compatible
* Update CMake scripts to disallow VTK5/6 and to fetch only VTK7

Remove Qt4 backward-compatibility code:
* Update CMake scripts to disallow Qt4
* Remove Qt4 specific code from PlusApp

How to join the project is described at the bottom of the main page and in User documentation / How to report an error (http://perk-software.cs.queensu.ca/plus/doc/nightly/user/ReportError.html).

I took a quick look at url:https://app.assembla.com/spaces/plus/wiki/Users_guide|User's guide and Developer's Guide, and Googled for 'Assembla join project'. I also looked at url:https://app.assembla.com/spaces/plus/team|Team to see if I can add or invite her.

Thanks, the filename is shown nicely now.

The tooltip in the dropdown is useful because the listbox is not always wide enough to show the full name of the device set (see the screenshot). So, I think we should keep showing the device set name.

We may also consider showing the device set description in the tooltip. If you think  it looks nice and useful, then add that, too.

As we discussed, if you can limit the tooltip width then add the device set description to the tooltip, too. If we cannot control the tooltip width then you can close this ticket as is, without modifying the current implementation.

## #886 Make fCal easier to use without a foot pedal
* Stylus calibration: have a timer (wait for a few seconds after clicking the start button, before actually starting to collect data)
* Phantom calibration: auto-detect pivoting with stationary tip and use mean position (this also makes the point position more accurate); implement the algorithm in a separate class so that we can easily port it to SlicerIGT (Fiducial Registration Wizard module)
* Temporal calibration: have a timer
* Spatial calibration: have a timer


#### 2014-05-15, 17:21:39 - Adam Rankin
If we're getting really fancy, then maybe we could have a visible countdown before data collection.

re #886 pivot detecting (vtkPivotDetectionAlgo) works for several pivots in row, still may need some clean but it is ready to put into fcal. vtkReadTrackedSignals class and plotting is not necessary but was (and might) be useful for testing. Tests need to be cleaned up, PivotDetectionTest might be redundant so maybe better to remove later.

There is a failing test on linux: http://crunch.cs.queensu.ca/CDash/testDetails.php?test=564676&build=28429

Make sure that tests only require a terminal (don't require a graphics window). This is usually achieved by adding an optional --rendering-off command-line parameter (see for example TrackingTest.cxx), which can be used for disabling rendering for automatic testing.

#### 2014-09-18, 17:15:52 - Andras Lasso
Tried to test the algorithm in simulation mode and I've found a few issues:
* Merge vtkPivotDetectionAlgo element attributes into vtkPhantomLandmarkRegistrationAlgo (it would be just too complex for the user to have another element and there is significant overlap between the two elements)
* If pivot detection attributes are missing then use default values (this way we avoid the need to add pivot detection attributes to all existing configuration files)
* ObjectMarkerCoordinateFrame='Stylus' - this is not necessary and should be removed. Use a coordinate system that is computed by translating the StylusTip by 10cm along the X axis (X axis corresponds to the stylus shaft direction, see http://perk-software.cs.queensu.ca/plus/doc/nightly/user/CommonCoordinateSystems.html)
* Rename AbovePivotThresholdMM to AbovePivotThresholdMm and PivotThresholdMM to PivotThresholdMm for consistency (Mm is more readable than MM, for example MmPerPixel vs MMPerPixel)
* Add a fake tracker mode that simulates pivoting

#### 2014-09-18, 17:49:40 - Andras Lasso
This line caused crash when trying the registration in simulation mode:
ui.label_Instructions->setText(QString('The landmark %1 is already detected\
\
').arg(m_PhantomLandmarkRegistration->GetDefinedLandmarkName(m_CurrentLandmarkIndex-1).c_str()));

m_CurrentLandmarkIndex was 0 => GetDefinedLandmarkName was attempted for -1

#### 2014-09-18, 17:57:21 - Andras Lasso
More things to fix/improve:
* threshold of detecting that we are near an existing point: closest distance/3 instead of /2
* fix the number in the orange message (we are too close point # x)
* auto-rotate to next point: vtkCamera::SetFocalPoint = LandmarkPointsCenterOfGravity_Reference, vtkCamera::SetPosition = LandmarksCenterOfGravityPoint_Reference-500*(CurrentLandmarkPoint_Reference-LandmarksCenterOfGravityPoint_Reference), vtkCamera::SetViewUp = PhantomToReferenceTransform*PhantomViewUpVector_Phantom (PhantomViewUpVector_Phantom can be constant: [0,0,1] vector

#### 2014-09-18, 18:17:14 - Andras Lasso
One more thing: Disable 'Record point' button until phantom registration is started. Otherwise it's not really clear for the user if the phantom registration is in progress or not. Accordingly, rename 'Start Pivot Detection' to 'Start phantom registration' (also note the capitalization: in Plus we always capitalize the first letter only).

## #887 Allow hiding of phantom without hiding wires
It would be often useful to see only the wires and the image plane in 3D to verify their alignment, but when the wires are shown then the phantom is always shown, too, which makes it difficult to see the wires.
Allow the user to hide only the phantom, while still seeing the wires (have a separate option for show/hide phantom and show/hide wires).

## #890 Cube artifacts in Volume Reconstruction
When Calculation='MAXIMUM' parameter is added to the VolumeReconstruction element of the PLUS config file then bright cubes appear around bright voxels. What it should do is only update a single voxel with the maximum value, not fill a whole kernel with it.

Here is a folder with everything you need to reproduce this issue:
s:\\data\\SlicerIGT\\2014-05-26_BugReport\\
Just run the .bat file to generate the ...-VolRec.mha file that contains the bright cubes.

Hi Tamas,

I noticed in the config file that the 'interpolation' field was set to 'LINEAR' (which I think is the default). This causes each input pixel to be distributed over a 2*2*2 kernel, which could explain the artefact you saw.
If I change it to 'NEAREST_NEIGHBOR' (each pixel is distributed to only the nearest voxel), I see a very different result. For comparison:

Nearest Neighbor: https://www.assembla.com/spaces/plus/documents/bJo8KW5tmr44k6acwqjQYw/download/bJo8KW5tmr44k6acwqjQYw
Linear: https://www.assembla.com/spaces/plus/documents/bYwXa45tmr45bAdmr6bg7m/download/bYwXa45tmr45bAdmr6bg7m

Does this look like it will address the problem?

I wonder if it might be worth renaming the parameters to be a bit more clear? I don't know if 'Interpolation' is quite the right word to describe what that particular parameter does.

Thomas

Thanks. Setting NEAREST_NEIGHBOR seems to improve the result. Could you please explain what this parameter does? Interpolation does not really give away much. First I thought that it interpolates between multiple input slices when more than one is available for one output voxel. But I figured out that is 'Calculation'.
BTW 'Calculation' is another very confusing term. As anything that happens on a computer is 'calculation'. If you know the meanings of these parameters, it would be very useful to rename them.
And why would the input pixel be distributed over a 2x2x2 (or any) kernel? Does that help in any situation? To me it is just blur.

> Could you please explain what this parameter does? [...] And why would the input pixel be distributed over a 2x2x2 (or any) kernel? Does that help in any situation? To me it is just blur.

The 'Interpolation' parameter describes *_where_* each input pixel intensity is distributed.

In the most common case, an input pixel intensity will be distributed to the spatially nearest voxel. This is 'Nearest Neighbor'.

In a more complex case, we would take into consideration the fact that a pixel could be anywhere. It is rare that a pixel would be located exactly on a grid point in a volume, rather it is usually located _between_ the grid points. The pixel intensity could be distributed to the 8 surrounding voxels according to a distance weight. This is what the 'Linear' (reverse tri-linear interpolation) does.

I think 'Distribution' would be a better parameter name.

> 'Calculation' is another very confusing term. As anything that happens on a computer is 'calculation' [...] If you know the meanings of these parameters, it would be very useful to rename them.

A voxel could have had several input pixel intensities distributed into it. The 'Calculation' parameter describes *_how_* to determine the final voxel intensity from the input pixel intensities. In truth, 'Compounding' would probably be a better word to describe what this parameter does, but that name is already used for something else...

---

Everything should be renamed all at once. The names of many of the parameters are mixed-up or confusing. Not only that, but I'm unsure whether all of the volume reconstructor's functionality is necessarily useful... maybe worth talking about?

Would we want to support old config files without the new names / is that realistic?

Thanks for the explanation. Renaming these would be very useful, as now I see that the names don't reflect the functionality at all. Of course renaming is not an urgent issue. Maybe another ticket should be created for that with low priority...

So this 'bug' is not really a bug. The only problem is that linear distribution and maximum intensity compounding don't go well with each other. Now that I understand the issue, I would be OK with just a note on the wiki page of volume reconstruction that warns users who use maximum intensity compounding that they should set distribution to nearest neighbour.

Actually, MAXIMUM is a compounding operator. So, Compounding options should be NONE (or OFF), MEAN, MAXIMUM. So, the 'Calculation' attribute can be removed.

The 'Interpolation' attribute name is accurate, so it should be kept.

It's not trivial how to do linear interpolation with MAXIMUM compounding: what should be the weight of the existing voxel value. If we try a few weights and none of them give nice results then we may disallow combining MAX with LINEAR.



#### 2014-05-27, 12:21:39 - Thomas Vaughan
Thanks Andras. What should be the behaviour when Compounding == NONE?

Perhaps we should print a warning to the console when MAXIMUM is combined with LINEAR? I agree that it is not trivial. I wonder if giving weights could be misleading, since it's no longer a 'MAXIMUM'.

Compounding == NONE: latest pixel value in the output volume
Compounding == MAX: highest pixel value in the output volume
Compounding == MEAN: mean of all pixel values in the output volume

Before disabling the MAXIMUM&LINEAR combination I would try how the results look if we compute the updated pixel like NONE&LINEAR but we only modify the volume if the new pixel is brighter (f=fraction of the input pixel inside the output voxel):


~~~~


if (*inPtrTmp > *outPtrTmp)
{
  *outPtrTmp = *inPtrTmp * f + *outPtrTmp * (1-f);
}
else
{
  // darker value, ignore it

I'm presently having problems getting PLUS to compile. I followed the latest building instructions for developers (and updated all the relevant tools), but when I compile in VS get several errors. They are all variations of:

When there are major version changes (e.g., ITK3=>ITK4) you cannot do an in-place update.
Delete all the contents in your PlusExperimental-bin directory (itk, itk-bin, vtk-vtk-bin, ... all of these). Then reconfigure your project and build from scratch.

Test #890. Using LINEAR interpolation, the compounding operator for LATEST and MAXIMUM is only applied if the trilinear weight is 0.125 or higher (one over eight). I chose one over eight, since there are eight corners and a pixel right in the middle should be applied to each of them, else it should only be applied to the nearest corner(s).

Sure, I'll do that next week when I'm back in the lab.

Do we want to do a test for each combination of CompoundingMode + Interpolation? Or is it sufficient if each appears at least once?

This is partially done already. The user should get a warning when using 'Compounding' or 'Calculation'. I have not yet changed 'CompoundingMode' based on those inputs, since the intended effect may be ambiguous (for instance, Compounding=Off suggests LATEST is intended, but if in addition Calculation=Mean, then MEAN might be intended?). I see two things that could be done here:
1. Attempt to interpret what the user wanted to do, output that choice to the screen in a warning; or,
2. Output an error if CalculationMode is absent. Say that CalculationMode must be supplied.
Which should be done?

>> update all config files in PlusExp-bin\\PlusLib\\data\\ConfigFiles to use the new attributes
The ones that are used for volume reconstruction testing should have been updated already. I will check for others next week.

(I'll also correct the magic number when I'm next in the lab)

#### 2014-08-16, 17:00:22 - Andras Lasso
It would be nice to test several combinations. We should not increase the total testing time more than by maximum about 30 seconds, so choose the parameters accordingly.
LIN+MAX, LIN+MEAN, LIN+LATEST, NN+MAX, NN+MEAN, NN+LATEST, and vary other parameters randomly (enabled/disabled hole filling, linear/curvilinear transducer).

If obsolete params specified then log a warning and do a reasonable guess, for example:
Compounding = off => CompoundingMode = LATEST
Compounding = on => CompoundingMode = MEAN
Calculation = MAXIMUM => CompoundingMode = MAXIMUM (regardless of the Compounding value)

Thank you!

@matt.mccormick Thanks for your contribution! As there are several similarities between vtkIntersonSDKCxxVideoSource and vtkIntersonVideoSource it would make sense to create an abstract base class and put SDK-specific details (iSDK and SDKCxx) into two child classes. What do you think?

What are your plans with vtkIntersonSDKCxxVideoSource? Do you plan to add more features, clean up things, etc? Do you have time to contribute with implementation and/or testing to the consolidation of the iSDK and SDKCxx classes?

#### 2014-06-09, 16:04:24 - Matt McCormick
@lassoan I did not expect much overlap with the old SDK, but I am open to suggestions.  Interson said they re-wrote the new SDK from scratch, so I do not expect many similarities.  Are there particular methods you think should be shared?  I don't have access to the old SDK or an old probe, so I would need some help testing.

Other todo's here include fixing the probe initialization -- there is something odd going on in that the SDK example application needs to be run before it starts populating the buffer.  RF output needs to be added, too.  Any suggestions on examples to look at for reference on how to best add both BMode and RF dual output are welcome :-).

#### 2014-06-09, 16:52:54 - Andras Lasso
These Interson classes are quite similar. The hardware architecture and capabilities are also very similar, so it is very likely that we'll use them the same way.

I'll create the common base class and move both classes into the same directory. I just wait for confirmation from Guillermo that he doesn't have any pending changes.

We'll have a look at concurrent B/RF-mode acquisition. I think the BK ultrasound class may serve as example.

A short note on this comment (in SetDepth): // Since we are not using their scan converter, this does not have much effect

It's not just the scan conversion parameters, but pulse frequency and sample rate parameters need to be changed, too (see the attached ppt in  #869), if you want to have optimal image quality. Also, if we want to do the scan conversion then we need to get the probe geometry from the SDK (or define it in the config file).

#### 2014-06-09, 17:15:08 - Matt McCormick
The pulse frequency / sample rate / clock divider no longer need to be paired like they did in the old probe / SDK.

They don't export the probe geometry in the public methods of their SDK, so we will either need to hard code them on in the Plus .cxx files or define them in the config file.

Is the frequency/sample rate/clock divider constant for all depths when the new SDK is used?

If the probe geometry is not available in the SDK then we should store it in the config file (there is already an XML element to describe probe geometry).

#### 2014-06-09, 21:12:38 - Andras Lasso
Do you plan to add IntersonSDKCxx to PlusBuild? (add an option, if enabled then download from github, build it, make PlusLib to use it - the same way as for OpenIGTLink, ITK, VTK)

#### 2014-06-09, 21:17:49 - Matt McCormick
With the new probe/SDK, yes, the sample rate/clock divider is constant for all frequencies.  When a different depth is set on their scan converter, it just shows the depths requested (a subset of what is actually acquired).

I'll add the probe geometry to the config file, then.

Yes, I'll add IntersonSDKCxx to PlusBuild like the other projects.  I'll get a config file that does the scan conversion so we can view the probe content with PlusApp.

Thanks for the pointers.

@matt.mccormick Plus should provide hardware abstraction for US imaging devices as much as possible. For most US systems the desired imaging depth can be set and Plus and/or the device driver figures out the optimal acquisition parameters to achieve that. Could you implement such mechanism for this device, too?

For example:
* Instead of requiring the user to figure out if he needs decimation or not, we could decide automatically from the requested depth (we would only enable decimation if the desired depth cannot be reached without decimation) and we might also clip the part of the RF lines that are over the requested depth (to optimize speed and memory consumption).
* It would be nice if the scan conversion parameters could be computed from a few simple user inputs, such as: DepthMm and TransducerModel (a string, such as 'GP 3.5MHz', which would be used to look up/compute the optimal TransducerGeometry, RadiusStartMm, ThetaStartDeg, ThetaStopDeg, OutputImageSizePixel, TransducerCenterPixel, and OutputImageSpacingMmPerPixel values). The SDK should already provide at least the TransducerModel name (so the user would not need to specify it), but ideally the SDK should also provide info about the probe's physical dimensions and capabilities. If the SDK does not provide these info then we should ask Interson to add such methods (and until they add it we may need to ask the user to specify the TransducerModel with a string and add tables to Plus that contain parameters for each TransducerModel).

#### 2014-06-30, 04:10:02 - Matt McCormick
@lassoan Yes, it sounds good to provide or compute reasonable defaults when possible. I'll add this to the roadmap, although I will need to work on other priorities in the near term.

## #894 Phantom registration missing although performed successfully
What I found out so far is, that I do have the problem of missing Phantom registration (although it was performed succesfully) only when using NDI Poplaris. I do not have the problem, when using the NDI Aurora. I've also tried to begin from scratch using a new configuration file --> same result, I can not perform spatial calibration because of the message 'phantom registration is missing. it needs to be performed or imported'. But as already mentioned, Phantom registration was performed successfully. Under spatial calibration, where I do get the message of missing phantom registration, also the button to import phantom registration results is grayed out, so it is not possible to import any phantom registeration. But this only applays when using NDI Polaris. When using NDI Aurora all works fine. I do not even get the message of a missing phantom registratin.
As I began from scratch, I do not have any idea whats going wrong. So it seems there is a bug in the software, preventing to start spacial calibration

Is the config file the same for the NDI Aurora? If not, could you attach it?

Yup, the configuration file for the Aurora is the same as for the Polaris. Except for the used device they are the same.

I've uploaded the Debug logs once for the Polaris device and once for the Aurora Device including both configuration files. Hope that helps.
Again, it did work for the Aurora but not for the Polaris.

#### 2014-05-29, 12:34:05 - Adam Rankin
Ok I'll take a look. Thanks.

#### 2014-05-29, 12:36:49 - Adam Rankin
Try adding

ToolReferenceFrame='Tracker'

to the NDI polaris file.

As of a few patches ago, the default tool coordinate frame for a tracker has changed because you can now have multiple trackers in a single device set.

In order to prevent name collisions, the coordinate frame of a tracker is set to the name of the device if not specified.

#### 2014-05-29, 13:02:33 - reiker
that did not help. the problem still exists. i've uploaded the new config but it should be correct, at least i hope so.

Could you try the latest release?
I've also made some cleanups in the Polaris device yesterday, so if the latest release still have problems then I can create a release from the current version and you can try that.

In the meantime, I'll analyze the log file further and let you know if I find the root cause of the issue.

#### 2014-05-29, 14:04:21 - Adam Rankin
The ToolReferenceFrame attribute must be within the tracker device tag.

You have 


~~~~

    <Device
      Id='TrackerDevice'
      Type='PolarisTracker'
      SerialPort='3'
      BaudRate='115200'
      AcquisitionRate='50'
      LocalTimeOffsetSec='0.0'>
      ToolReferenceFrame='Tracker'

and it must be

    <Device
      Id='TrackerDevice'

#### 2014-05-29, 14:56:54 - reiker
Oh, what a mistake. Thanks for the info. I will trie so the next week.
About using the latest version, i've used PlusApp_2.1.0.2971 on XP-machine and PlusApp-2.1.1.3273 on Windows 7, same results.
As i'm not able to compile the latest version, could you compile it and upload it. That would be great, so I can give it a trie next week.
Thanks, Reinhard

#### 2014-06-02, 10:50:53 - reiker
I've tried now with included ToolReferenceFrame attribute within the tracker device configuration, but it still does not work. I do get the same message.

The problem was that the probe coordinate system was called 'Tool' in the data collector and it was called 'Probe' in fCal and the ProbeCalibration elements.

#### 2014-06-02, 14:20:55 - Andras Lasso
fixed #894: Changed the error message that is printed when phantom calibration is not found. Now the coordinate frame names are printed and it is noted that coordinate frame mismatches can cause the error, too.

## #896 Add a command line tool to Plus installer
There are lots of tools in PLUS that only have command line interface. There is also lots of documentation on the wiki pages on how to use these tools (e.g. VolumeReconstructor, EditSeqMetaFile, etc). But most people are not comfortable using the command line.
It would make these command line tools easier to use if Plus users had access to a command line terminal where all the Plus executables are in the PATH.

I suggest when PLUS is installed, an icon gets created in the Start menu (besides fCal and PlusServer) that opens the command line terminal with PLUS bin folder in the PATH. It could be called like 'PLUS terminal', or 'PLUS CLI'.

## #899 Clean up PlusLib library exports
For some external libraries FIND_PACKAGE is in PlusLibConfig.cmake while for others it is int UsePlusLib.cmake:

FIND_PACKAGE(VTK PATHS '@VTK_DIR@' NO_DEFAULT_PATH)

## #900 PortUsImageOrientation no effect
As I have a problem with inaccurate spacial calibration I figured out, that fCal does not correctly recognice the wires (see screenshot). It can be seen, that wire 9:M1_m1 should be wire 1:H5_h5 and vice versa. As mentioned in the documentation I've tried to change the PortUSImageOrientation, as this seeting seems not to be correct, because the left side of the image is the marked side and the upper part of the image is the far side. Indifferent from the PortUSImageOrientation setting, the green arows always shows M to the right and F down. I've tried several settings, but nothing helps.
I then tried to change DisplayedImageOrientation setting, but this seems only to change the display of the US Image in fCal but not in the spacial calibration parameter settings. There also seems to be a problem, because when changing from MarkedLeft FarUp to MarkedLeft FarDown the Image orientation changes as well as the green Arows, so Far is always wrong, indifferently from the settings.
Screenshots:

wrong far 1:
the far side is on the bottom of the immage, so MarkedLeft Far Down should be correct, but when switching to it, the far side changes to the bottom of the image and the green arrow also changes from Near to Far.

wrong far 2:
The far side is on the top of the image, so marked Left Far Up should be correct, but when switching to it, the far side changes to the bottom of the image and the green arrot also changes from Far to Near

Whatever I'm doing, it' not possible to change the Far side of the US-Image

wrong wires:
in the spacial calibration parameter settings dialog there is no chance to change the Far and Marked side (tried with PortUsImageOrientation setting) and also the wires are not correctly identified.

Seems there is a bug.

it also seems interesting that the image is up side down, but only in fcal. when using vtkWin32VideoSourceTest.exe the image is correctly aligned.
But when using a webcam the image is also correctly aligned in fcal.

re #900: Fixed video for windows device port orientation (the UsPortImageOrientation parameter in the config file was ignored)
Commit: r:3375|plus:3375

#### 2014-06-05, 18:38:19 - Adam Rankin
The green arrows only change when you change the visualization of the image via the Gear icon at the top left of fCal. PortUsImageOrientation changes the acquired orientation. fCal then flips it to MF internally.

Using the test MMF webcam configuration I can successfully change the input orientation of the image.

#### 2014-06-05, 18:39:19 - Adam Rankin
Your images also show different orientations. It looks like images 1 and 2 are flipped. Did you change the orientation between these acquisitions?

#### 2014-06-05, 18:47:51 - reiker
yup, i changed the orientation via the gear icon, but only for wrong far 1 and wrong far 2. See image description in the first post

re #900: Allow setting of SetScreenRightDownAxesOrientation even if Rendering element is missing (the missing element is added so that the setting will be saved to the config file)
Commit: r:3379|plus:3379

#### 2014-06-05, 21:30:47 - reiker
By flipping the orientation I tried to get the correct alignment, but that did not work. It is not possible to change the far or near side. I thought it is possible to orientate the image right that it is not up side down anymore, but this is not possible.

About the green arrows only changeing when changeing the visualization of the image:
when trying to change marked and unmarked side, the green arrow does not change but to your description adam, it should change. maybe this is also a bug, as related to ticket #696

quotation from adam #696:
During one run, switching the view orientation resulted in the U/M label getting 'stuck'. The view would update but not the labelling. I was able to update the display by switching to 3d mode and back to 2d mode...

## #901 More descriptive config file parameter names needed
Some parameter names in the config files are still not informative enough. E.g.
VolumeReconstruction/OutputSpacing -- this could be OutputSpacingPixelsPerMm.
VolumeReconstruction/ClipRectangleOrigin ans Size -- this is clear for people who are familiar with VTK: http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Tutorials/Extents , but not clear to other people. Maybe if units were added, that would make it easier to understand.

In general, when a parameter gives a measure, units must be specified in the name. When the parameter gives a geometrical object (point, vector, rectangle), it would be nice to also specify the coordinate system where the object is defined.

## #902 Improve Plus remote module in 3D Slicer
Recording:
* Query the list of recording devices from PlusServer and show a list for the Capture Device ID instead of a text entry field.
** User selects a connection
** PlusRemove asks for the list of capture device IDs: <Command Name='RequestDeviceIds' DeviceType='VirtualDiscCapture' /> (something like this in the code: commandCounter = slicer.modules.openigtlinkremote.logic().ExecuteCommand(connectorNodeId, 'RequestDeviceIds', parameters)), see documentation of commands at PlusServer_commands
** getCommandReply to get the response
** update the listbox with the parsed response
=> Whenever the connection node changes (e.g., connected, disconnected) then refresh the device ID list
=> Make sure the list is up-to-date when first entering the module
=> Add support for simultaneous command processing (have a list of commands active, each with an associated action and remaining time)

Connection:
* Don't let the user to run any command until the connection is established

Reconstruction:
* Query the list of volume reconstructor devices from PlusServer and show a list in the reconstruction section.
* Allow the user to select from a list which sequence to reconstruct (now the last recorded sequence is reconstructed).
* Add user interface to specify output volume spacing.
* Add user interface to specify output extent and direction (with text box and ROI widget).
* Add 'scout scan' feature: set output extent using a quick, low-resolution scan.
* Add possibility to ask for snapshots during live volume reconstruction
* Add option to draw the acquired image slices as thin surface models while acquiring the frames to give an idea what parts are covered already by the scan and if the scanning speed is too high or too low 

Transform update:
* Query the current device set config file name and display it (this would allow the user to know which config file will be updated)

Tool status display
* Show for each transform if they are valid (a transform is valid if it is regularly updated; if there is no update for a long time, e.g., a half second then its status have to be set to unavailable)

## #903 fCal won't launch due to missing .dll when Qt built with -debug-and-release

Just a hint: If you've rebuilt Qt after Plus was configured before with Qt -release only option you need to delete Qt related CMake variables and run configure again so FindQt can recheck your Qt bin directory to find debug dlls. Make sure your QT_CORE_LIBRARY_DEBUG CMake variable has the correct debug lib (QtCored4.lib) and not the release one (QtCore4.lib). 
You can easily delete Qt variables in CMake Grouped view, by selecting Qt and click on Remove Entry button and run Configure again. Make sure you do the same with VTK as well (It uses Qt also) prior to Plus. Hope it helps. 

#### 2014-06-12, 16:30:38 - Adam Rankin

And now I know that fCal links against a tiny .lib which loads the appropriate .dll

Continuing my investigations.

#### 2014-06-12, 16:40:07 - Adam Rankin
The configuration for linker properties in visual studio for debug contains both debug and release versions of the .lib files.

I wonder if FindQT4.cmake is not generating the proper cmake syntax?

#### 2014-06-12, 17:24:03 - Tamas Heffter
I would check QVTK.dll (vtk could cause the problem too) and all fCal dependent dlls with dependency walker (http://www.dependencywalker.com) to make sure it uses the correct debug dlls. 
My linker dependences shows only debug libs for Qt:

But temporal calibration did work with the previous version of fcal and i did not change anything of the setup or the config file. Do you have any ideas what can be wrong?

What I found out so far about temporal calibration with the latest version:

when changing the configuration parameter PortUsImageOrientation from 'UN' to 'MF', temporal calibration works, but it does not and allways cancels when using it as follows: PortUsImageOrientation='UN'. Seems like it is a bug.

As fixed stream I used the settings you suggested. I also checked the clipping area, that did not help. The interesting thing is that it works when changing PortUsImageOrientation from US to MF. That's why I think it is a bug.

## #909 Malware warning when downloading a release
Google Chrome (and newer Internet Explorer versions) displays a warning when attempting to download a Plus binary release:
'PlusApp... .exe is malicious and Chrome has blocked it'

The file is not infected (scanned with multiple online scanners, such as https://www.metascan-online.com or https://www.virustotal.com). Downloading the same file form a OneDrive shared folder works without any problem.

This is a common problem when offering download of executable files, many independent software developers complain.

Signing the installer solves the problem for some, but a signing key costs a few hundred $ a year and it adds additional administration work.

Probably hosting the executables on a different server (e.g., on innovate, where we host the generated documentation) may be a simpler solution. The same package that was flagged as malware could be downloaded successfully from innovate.

I don't know if this will help you, but I tried running this with and without optimization. When I use the config file below, it seems to work fine. The problem must be specific to the optimized version of vtkPasteSlicesIntoVolume.

It's very strange - when I run the reconstructor without hole filling and full optimization, the result looks normal.
When I reconstruct with nearest neighbor hole filling (as opposed to sticks) and full optimization, I get another type of artefact.

Fixed #915, corrected the accumulation buffer calculation in vtkPasteSliceIntoVolumeHelperCommon - extra multiplications by 256 were occuring. I do not know for certain why this caused the observed bug, but I suspect some kind of overflow in the fixed point class (fixed.h), which is used only when optimization is set to FULL.

Regarding the code provided - it is not of great quality at the moment and will be updated in the future. For example, there is at least one hard coded path in the make files. As well, the daVinci class is not intended to be portable or work with the generic user. It was designed with only one user in mind. This can be improved.

The CMake files should work now. daVinci was renamed to IntuitiveDaVinci, so you have to reconfigure and build PlusBuild.sln.

Thanks!

On the latest revision, and using the CMake GUI, after enabling the PLUS_USE_IntuitiveDaVinci option I get the expected CMake error (as the include directory and the library are not on the path hints). However, after specifying the location of the include directory and the library, I still get the CMake Erorr. 

I also have a bug in in the FindIntuitiveDaVinci.cmake file. Line 30 should read IF(IntuitiveDaVinci_FOUND). This didn't fix the error however.

Great thanks! Configuration and generation are good now. Built PlusBuild.sln. and compilation failed due to various errors. 

I've attached a proposed patch file that does the following:

- PlusApp\\InstallFiles.cmake renamed PLUS_USE_DAVINCI to PLUS_USE_IntuitiveDaVinci
- Renamed the daVinci class to be IntuitiveDaVinci
- Added the missing #ifndef guard to the daVinci class
- Various compilation fixes to both classes

For my current build, it sits at linker errors with the ISI API itself. I think this is specific to my machine, and will investigate tomorrow.

Thanks for the help in this ticket!

Understood. I have a tendency to use Visual Studio's defaults (via ctrl+k, ctrl+f). 

There are going to be a few more changes to this, particularly the IntuitiveDaVinci class, especially as I debug and step through it in practice. Expect a few more patches in the near future.

Curiously, I think there's a CMake step missing still. 

After fixing the compilation issues, the compiler fails to link in the ISI API libraries.Trying to build the PlusLib project in the PlusBuild.sln, the first few messages are:

I've been able to solve most of my issues, but I'm stuck on a CMake related change. I thought I understood what needed to be changed, but evidently I do not. I also think I'm making the same mistake when editing these files, but am not clear on what that mistake is. 

The ISI library depends on two additional Windows libraries (ws2_32 and iphlpapi).  I thought the attached patch would link those libs in properly, but it doesn't.

Could someone point on what I`m doing wrong in these changes?

## #917 General cleanup of da Vinci related classes
Currently the code for da Vinci tracker support do not adhere completely to the Plus coding conventions. This includes the use of printf, whitespace, private variables, etc.

This ticket is to clean up code and adhere to the conventions.

## #918 Consolidate ultrasound imaging devices
There are many common properties of ultrasound imaging devices, which should be implemented once and be reused in all the ultrasound imaging device classes.

For example:
- reading of imaging parameters from the config file (allow default values and 'undefined' values)
- setting of imaging parameters in the hardware (set all the defined parameters when connecting to the hardware and allow setting parameters immediately when already connected to the hardware)
- allow notifications to be sent as OpenIGTLink commands (e.g., button pressed on the probe)

vtkUsImagingParameters class is an early attempt which did not really work out. Probably a common base class would be more useful.

#### 2016-07-13, 16:50:45 - Adam Rankin
Closing as fixed. This ticket got lost. The vtkUsImagingParameters is active and functional. the base class vtkPlusUsDevice is active and functional.

## #921 Use the da Vinci logging functionality
Currently very little of the da Vinci logging functions are used. The API does provide some logging, and it is able to tell the API to log to a certain file. This will be helpful in debugging and logging messages in addition to what is logged in PLUS.

If the API provides a way to send log messages to Plus (e.g., through a callback function) then you can write the messages into the Plus log file. If there is no such mechanism then probably the simplest is specify an additional attribute in the device set config file to allow the user to set log file name.

I've noticed quite a few failed volume reconstructions on CDash since this commit, apparently caused by a segmentation fault.  There doesn't seem to be a pattern to these occurrences, so I don't know if this is a problem or just random errors.

#### 2014-08-16, 15:40:55 - Andras Lasso
Random crash is a huge issue. It has to be fixed ASAP. Can you reproduce it on your computer?

#### 2014-08-16, 15:43:11 - Thomas Vaughan
No, I did about 20 volume reconstructions yesterday, but none of them resulted in a segmentation fault.

What's strange on CDash is that these segmentation faults either happen for all volume reconstructions, or none at all.

OK. I see a configuration error on those computers where the tests failed. It may be possible that due to the configuration error the build was incomplete and old version of compiled library was used with the new header. I've fixed the configuration error, so let's see in the next nightly build if the reconstruction error disappears (hopefully it will).

#### 2014-08-17, 13:57:59 - Andras Lasso
The tests look good now, which confirms that it was just a configuration error and not the volume reconstruction algorithm caused the crashes.

Test #924, Merged the functionality of the 'Compounding' and 'Calculation' parameters in the volume reconstruction config. Both of these tags are now deprecated. Now there is a unified 'CompoundingMode' (renamed 1. to emphasize the difference in how they are used, and 2. to help detect deprecated config file setup). If CompoundingMode is absent from the config, then MEAN is assumed. If Compounding or Calculation are present in the config, then the user will be warned that those are deprecated. I've updated the config files in the test directories, but updates elsewhere will probably be necessary. The LATEST CompoundingMode will need to be tested.

## #929 Add parts and markers for fixture system
Plus Fixture System will be a set of printable tools that interface between objects and tracking markers.

Talked with Claron, and they suggested
* Marker holders can be thinner to reduce weight of fixtures. Down to 2 mm.
* An orthogonal stabilizer on the back of the marker holders can run down like a triangle from the fixing point.
* Lots of material between the cross markers could be removed.
* Marker holders with orthogonal faces can be configured so that marker works with the tracker from any direction.
* Sterilizer compatible markers can be machined for about 500 dollars each. If we need this, they can give a contact.

Todo:
* Marker holder in 4 orientations (STL)
* 0.1 mm tolerance needed on all sides for plugging in. (Tried 0.05 and it was too tight.)

## #931 Auto-detect actual clipping fan angles
When a curvilinear transducer is used, often only a part of the transducer touches the skin surface. Areas where the transducer does not touch the skin surface appear black, which may cause artifacts in the volume reconstruction.

Check the image contents and determine the actual fan angle range where there is proper acoustic coupling and exclude the black areas.

## #934 Tool status is invalid after going out of view
I tested the out of view problems on the latest build of plusserver with SendValidTransformsOnly set to false.

I have a setup in which I track two different optical trackers using the NDI Polaris Hybrid system. At a certain time point during tracking I occlude one of the trackers to make sure it is not visible anymore on the camera. A short while later I make sure the tracker is visible again. In the case of the Polaris system, Plusserver stops providing transforms for both trackers as soon as one is occluded and functionality does not return when both sensors are visible again. So actually, as soon as one sensor is out of view, the system stops providing tracking data for all sensors.

Source: PluslogPolaris.txt (see attachment)
For Polaris Spectra at line 1784 we see that one of the optical sensors is out of view:
Line 1784: 090914_121438.203|DEBUG|022.565000| Polaris-SensorsToPolaris: vtkPlusBuffer: Cannot do data interpolation. The closest item to the requested time (time: 7222.545000, uid: 200) is invalid.|in ..\\..\\..\\PlusLib\\src\\DataCollection\\vtkPlusBuffer.cxx(1019)

After which plus tries to get the trackerbuffer at timestamp 14422.5 which is not available, even when the sensor is back in sight.

Line 1787: 090914_121438.223|TRACE|022.585000| vtkPlusDevice::GetTrackedFrameList(14422.5, 1)|in ..\\..\\..\\PlusLib\\src\\DataCollection\\vtkPlusChannel.cxx(581)

I perform the exact same experiment with the NDI Aurora tabletop field generator. Here I track four 6DOF sensors. During tracking I move one of the sensors out of the magnetic field. Plusserver stops sending tracking information for all sensors as soon as one is out of view. As soon as all sensors are back within the EM field Plusserver behaves normally again, and provides actual tracking data.

Source: PluslogAurora.txt (see attachment)
For Aurora Tabletop Fieldgenerator at line 6193 one of the sensors is out of view. At line 6846 Plusserver function goes back to normal.

So in both systems tracking information stops when only one sensor/tracker is out of view. I have a working sollution in which I send a unity matrix for sensors which are out of view. It works fine for me, since it is easy to test if a matrix is unity. But given the comments above better sollutions might be available. Please help.

Thanks, Jasper

@jaspernijkamp: You have LocalTimeOffsetSec='7200.0' in the config file, which is a huge number (2 hours - while this time offset is typically a small fraction of a second). Can you reproduce the error if you set the LocalTimeOffsetSec to 0 or a small value (0.1 or -0.1)?

It seems that the timestamp is computed incorrectly (local time offset applied twice?) after a tool is out of view: timestamps are around 7261 (7200 is the local time offset) and then suddenly timestamps are searched around (14461, which is 7200 more).

Hi Guys,

Thanks for the help. The problem actually seems to be related to the localtimeoffsetsec. It occurs only when the localtimeoffsetsec is larger than the time spent to get one sample. So if I use a framerate of 10, the problem occurs when the offset is 0.1 or larger.

OK, so it's a timeout problem then (in case of a timeout the error is not handled properly). I'll commit a fix soon.

Have you tried the live volume reconstruction option? It can give you the reconstructed volume in a few seconds after the recording has completed (actually it sends partially completed volumes during reconstruction). The live volume reconstruction can work in parallel with recording, so you can have your original frames as well (just test if the computer is fast enough to cope with these simultaneously). We may add an option to always save the raw frames, too, when doing live reconstruction.

## #938 Add a separate set of styluses (Stylus_60mm, Stylus_100mm) with a hole at the tip, where we can glue a pin/nail.
3D printed stylus is pretty good still sometimes might be worth to put at the end a metal tip, sharper and that does not break. Because the one used has been pivoted so many times that the tip is not so sharp anymore.

#### 2014-09-26, 15:06:37 - Andras Lasso
Instead of gluing we could create a hole where standard high-precision indicator tips (sharp or sphere) could be inserted.

For example, one of these:

## #939 Simplify FakeTracker
SavedDataSource device should be used for replaying data from file. Duplicating this functionality would lead to additional duplicate maintenance workload.
Therefore, RecordedPoseFrameList mode should be removed.

We do not plan to detect pivoting automatically during stylus calibration, therefore PivotCalibrationAutoDetect mode should be removed.

I have uploaded a proposed patch to fix this. Based on:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd389281(v=vs.85).aspx#setting_output_formats

which indicates that Mmf will automatically load a decoder (if available) to the requested output type. I have tested with a firewire video device presenting DVSD.

If you have a chance to review, please  me know if this is acceptable to commit (I think I still have access), or if you any changes are required. Thanks.

I quickly test it and let you know.

#### 2015-02-24, 21:01:30 - Isaiah Norton
By the way, there seems to be a bug if an epiphan device is connected. MediaFoundationVideoDevice::ResetDevice fails at line 190, so then the FriendlyName is set to NULL. Later on it still tries to use the device and construct a wstring from the null pointer. This leads to an access violation. My temporary solution was to unplug the epiphan, but I will send a patch to fix it.

#### 2015-02-24, 21:23:23 - Andras Lasso
I've tested your patch and did not find any difference (what worked still works, what did not work is not fixed either). Does the patch fixes something for you?

When I set my webcam resolution to 1280x720 then encoding is switched to MJPG (even though YUY2 is listed in the available modes and no error is reported when initializing that mode).
With your patch the encoding is switched to YUY2 but the resolution is also changed to 640x480.

re #940: don't use invalid MediaFoundation device.

If pActivate->ActivateObject fails then the MMF device is invalid and it should
not be enumerated. Keeping the device in the list causes a crash later
in MediaFoundationVideoCaptureApi::GetCaptureDeviceName.

#### 2015-03-10, 00:06:22 - Andras Lasso
Thanks for the fix!

#### 2015-03-10, 20:21:00 - Isaiah Norton
Regarding the issue with the webcam, does it work if you explicitly specify RGB24 as the format instead? Maybe Media Foundation can't automatically find a decode pathway to YUY2, but if you specify RGB24 if might find one (I'm not entirely sure how the selection works underneath. I think we would need to manually set up the url:https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms703138(v=vs.85).aspx |MF Transform paths to fully control this).

Are there any other issues to address in order to close this?

#### 2015-03-11, 18:38:44 - Andras Lasso
No, the webcam unfortunately does give RGB24 image at high resolution, even if we explicitly request it. I agree that probably MF transforms should be set up to handle this, but as we have a solution that works on all the clinical-grade imaging sources and we can find working video modes for most (all?) webcams, we can consider this ticked fixed.

## #943 Make PlusLib reusable from other applications
Goal: Algorithms implemented in Plus should be reusable from Slicer modules or other external applications.

Approach: Modify PlusLib so it is usable alone. Compile PlusLib without hardware support.

Tasks:
- Try to compile PlusLib in a SlicerIGT module. Create superbuild CMake that checks out the code. (Andras)
- In the same module implement conversion between Plus tracked frame list and sequence nodes (Multidim Data). (Matt)
- Check how module/extension dependency works in Slicer so this module would automatically install Multidim Data. (Lower priority, Matt)

## #944 Slicer 3D view update stops if the system is running for an extended period of time
Reported by Thomas Chen: I have tested the new PlusServer US610 Embedded nightly and it works well with our 6.1.0 Exam on Touch.  I did found one problem: after I set up the Slicer/SlicerIGT/PlusServer all working with tracked US and our GPS needle and acquire some volume, if I leave the system there for a couple of hours and come back, the 3D view (where the tracked image and needle) would cease to update the position when I move the probe and needle.  The 2D live US image still works so it means the data streaming to the 2D is fine, but strangely all updates to the 3D view stop.  I can still rotate/zoom the 3D view, but there is no response when I move the probe/needle.  This is not a random error and happens every time if I leave the system sit for a while.  I checked the PlusServer running on SonixTouch, it is connected fine.

#### 2014-10-23, 20:43:30 - Andras Lasso
Most likely it's a Slicer bug. Need to reproduce it to investigate.

#### 2014-10-27, 15:21:09 - Jaime Garcia Guevara
 Hello @thomasckr I am trying to reproduce this issue but still have not. 

I guess you disable the automatic freeze option from the sonix touch, right? If not do you get this errors 102414_190531.083|ERROR|7286.053000| Failed to get video buffer item UID from time: 5856.522917|in ..\\..\\..\\PlusLib\\src\\DataCollection\\vtkPlusChannel.cxx(999) in plus server? 

You said that the 2D image streaming in slicer is working, right? And the needle and US poses tracking are the ones that does not work any more, right?

#### 2015-04-25, 15:21:11 - Andras Lasso
Reproduced the issue: transformation matrix values were updating in the Transforms module but tools did not move, which confirms that it is a Slicer issue.

## #946 Performance issue on Ultrasonix machine with exam software 6.1
Running PlusServer on a Sonix Touch machine just to stream the 2D images thought the network already uses the CPU at 99% capacity. When volume reconstruction is requested though PlusServer there are unpredictable errors. E.g. command is not processed at all, or chunks of data is lost, etc.

A solution is to raise the priority of PlusServer in the Task Manager of Sonix Touch. A setting 'high' already provides acceptable user experience and no loss of data. Priority setting of 'real time' is even faster.

Usually we don't notice this issue on 6.1.1 (although we don't always use volume reconstruction). I think we should just add notes about workarounds to the user manual and then close this ticket.

re #948: Fixed SerialNumber documentation
Commit: r:3845|plus:3845


## #949 OpenIGTLink command receive latency gets longer if multiple clients are connected
Polling client for commands takes about 0.5-1 sec (if the client has not sent anything). It means in worst case the time it takes for PlusServer to process a command is 0.5sec * (NumberOfConnectedClients-1). This may result in a long latency in remote command processing if many clients are connected to PlusServer.

Probably the most robust solution would be to create a separate data receiver thread for each connected client. Then waiting on one client could not delay the processing of events received from another client.

## #950 Write saved data source input file path relative to the config file path
Currently when a saved data source device config is saved, the full absolute path of the sequence file is written to the config file. When the config file and sequence is moved, the sequence file cannot be found.

Proposed solution: Write saved data source input file path relative to the config file path

#### 2016-07-13, 16:52:29 - Adam Rankin
@lassoan Does PLUS look relative to the config file directory or to the Image directory as specified by PlusConfig.xml? (or both)

#### 2016-07-13, 18:08:29 - Andras Lasso
I've checked the code. Currently Plus looks for the sequence file in the image directory, then relative to config file directory, then in current working directory. So, this part is actually OK.

The issue is that the lookup of the full image file path is implemented in vtkPlusSavedDataSource::ReadConfiguration. The relative input path is converted to an absolute path and stored in SequenceFile member. The behavior should be changed to not store the found absolute path in the member variable.

Thanks for working on this. Have you fixed the problem that the file name is changed in the config file when the config file is saved?

The issue was that the relative path that was originally in the config file was replaced with an absolute path on save. Having an absolute path in the config file is bad, as it only works on the computer where that config file was saved.

Yup, the absolute path is only determined when loading the file. In all other instances this->SequenceFile contains exactly what is in the config file, so when written out it is the same.

with just a comment that REMOVE_IMAGE_DATA does not require changing of trackedFrameList (to make clear that processing is not done intentionally).

This is not needed either:
PlusStatus RemoveImageData( vtkTrackedFrameList* trackedFrameList)
{
  if ( trackedFrameList == NULL )

    LOG_ERROR('Tracked frame list is NULL!'); 
    return PLUS_FAIL;

Thanks Adam. Please also rename the trackerOnly flag to blankImage (or removeImageData or something similar), as we only know that we remove the image data. In general, a binary flag should never be called '...Only', because it may become obsolete if more flags or features are added (for example, if we add some other signal then trackerOnly would indicate that we remove that other signal, while the implementation only removes the image data).

## #954 Create image processor device for real-time bone enhancement
We finally agreed that in the near future we will implement ultrasound processing (bone segmentation) in PLUS, not Slicer. Andras will create a new virtual device in PLUS, like a Hello World device, that we can continue working on. Virtual devices take input data streams and produce output data streams. The output of the bone segmentation device can be either written to file, or sent to Slicer.

Yes, it works. We tried it a couple of weeks ago. I think this ticket could be closed. This is a good template for those who want to add image processing devices in the future. Although the long term plan is to add such algorithms in Slicer. Running potentially computation intensive algorithms in PLUS may delay real time data streams. So PLUS is best kept minimal. But it is good to have this option.

## #955 Enable support of 3D data in PLUS
With the goal of supporting the Philips ie33 probe (and hopefully other modalities/probes), it is necessary to support the acquisition of streaming volumes.

Currently, there is a driver/software package that can receive data from the Philips system, so this task will consist of retrofitting PLUS to support 3D image data, and creating a video source to support the ie33 probe.

This ticket focuses on retrofitting PLUS to support 3D.

instead?

#### 2015-02-03, 22:26:17 - Andras Lasso
For image orientation: we need to introduce a third axis. This axis is called 'elevational' direction in ultrasound imaging, so let's call the two axis ascending (A) and descending (D) direction. In a right-handed coordinate system if x=M, y=F, then z=cross(x,y)=A.
So, inside Plus everything would be in MFA coordinate system.

A 3D device can provide B-mode data in these orientations:
MFA = MF
MFD
MNA
MND = MN
UFA
UFD = UF
UNA = UN
UND

You don't need to implement flipping but report an error if flipping would have needed and not done.

When we write a 3D+t file then we should use these 3-letter acronyms. We could use aliases as above (assuming that the system is right-handed if only two letters are provided) but it would be cleaner to always use 3 letters when the data is 3D.

## #959 Enable support for bi-plane functionality for screen capture devices
Configurable bi-plane ROI based image bi-section for screen capture based devices

Configurable XML parameters in imaging device subtag for two ROI elements (4 points enough?)

Captured image can then be dissected using vtk image processing filter (if already exists, great!) to produce two output images

Two output images the put into two output video sources as per usual

Test and confirm openIGTLink sending of two image streams possible & performs well

#### 2015-02-03, 23:10:28 - Andras Lasso
I would suggest to do region extraction and image flip in one step (do flipping while copying pixels from the selected region).

#### 2015-02-03, 23:13:54 - Andras Lasso

    <Device

      Type='Epiphan' >
      <DataSources>
        <DataSource Type='Video' Id='VideoLeft' PortUsImageOrientation='MF' ClipRectangleOrigin='100 100' ClipRectangleSize='200 400' />
        <DataSource Type='Video' Id='VideoRight' PortUsImageOrientation='MF' ClipRectangleOrigin='400 100' ClipRectangleSize='200 400'  />

Pros: more explicit, can be dropped into any device (for example, openIGTLink video source) to have the same effect
Cons: need to link DataSourceIdOutput to a valid data source

#### 2015-02-08, 19:01:24 - Andras Lasso
For flexibility, we plan to implement any new image processing operation in separate devices (there is already 'ImageProcessor' base class and one example that extracts bone surface) instead of building it into an existing device. We could add a region extractor device but region extraction is so simple, so frequently needed (already implemented in several devices but still missing from some, see #433), and so linked with reordering (we copy pixels anyway, why not just copy&reorder once and only those pixels that we need) that it makes sense to implement it at the data source level.

Possible implementation:
* store clipping info the same place as orientation (DataSource element)
* pass clipping info along with orientation information to the flipping functions
* iterate through all output channels when copying frames from the device buffer to the circular buffer (such a for loop already implemented in Epiphan device, but it only supports different image orientations and color modes so far, not yet clipping)

re #959 Cleaning up Epiphan frame grab, if there were multiple output channels, it would attempt to grab multiple different frames. Limited to one output channel.

Commit: r:3966|plus:3966

#### 2015-02-09, 21:10:48 - Andras Lasso
Note that Epiphan has a unique feature: hardware cropping rectangle. Epiphan does not acquire the whole frame but only the region that we ask for; making the acquisition faster. Software clipping rectangles for each imaging plane is independent from this low-level hardware cropping (we need both; in all other imaging devices we only have the software clipping rectangle).

Commit: r:4435|plus:4435


## #960 Implement ascending/descending flip for 3D probes
Currently only xxA port image orientation is supported. If input is xxD then the image should be flipped around the third axis, but it is not implemented yet.


## #961 Change the StylusTip coordinate system axes definition
Needle shaft should be the Z axis instead of X axis, as using Z axis is much more commonly used in IGT systems.
https://github.com/SlicerIGT/SlicerIGT/issues/6

Also, the definition should be that the Z axis is the needle shaft. The tip to sensor direction is just an approximation in the stylus calibration algorithm (if no spin calibration is performed).

If it's a device that is held in hand in a particular orientation (e.g., buttons are at the top) then x axis points to the right and y axis points up (z axis points towards the user)

For backward compatibility, the simplest implementation, I would just instantiate one vtkPlusOpenIGTLinkServer object for each PlusOpenIGTLinkServer element in the config file. Having a separate vtkPlusOpenIGTLinkServer offers better parallelization as they would use separate sockets, so we could send over large images on one socket and it would not impact getting tracking info or small images with small latency through another socket.

Each server has its own processing thread, so we can start as many of them as needed. We only need to call server->ProcessPendingCommands(); sequentially for each server instance, as command processing is done from the main thread.

## #964 MMF video capture in RGB24 mode has inverted colors
User report:
I am using the Plus for the first time, and when I connected a usb cam and used the configuration file for PlusDeviceSet_Server_MmfColorVideoCapture. In the received image the colors is not correct, the red color is blue (I think it is captured as BRG) and I do not know how to correct that. There is a point I forget to clarify before, when I set the video format to 'YUY2' I can not see the image at all, So I changed it to 'RGB24'. then I get the Image and errors as attached.
the object that looks orange in the picture is blue one.

re #967 experimental approach to PlusServerLauncher
Commit: r:4019|plus:4019

#### 2015-03-02, 21:51:17 - Andras Lasso
Originally, PlusServerLauncher was supposed to launch a PlusServer instance but it ended up being much simpler to just run instantiate the server in the same process. However, having the server in a separate process has some advantages, so it's good if you can implement this separate process starting. Advantages include:
* we can open an OpenIGTLink server socket in PlusServerLauncher that allows remote clients to start/stop/restart a server (even sending the config file contents; this would allow us to store the device set config file on the Slicer computer, change the config file from the Slicer computer, etc.), the PlusServerLauncher could be started automatically when Windows starts
* in case of a crash, PlusServerLauncher would still be running so it could report the error, restart the server, etc.
* by having PlusServer in a separate process, we could make sure that all the resources, handles, memory, etc. are completely released when the server is restarted

There is no need to redirect console output to the small error log window for now (you can log still log PlusServerLauncher stuff there), but instead we could add a checkbox to show/hide the console window of the started PlusServer process. It is simpler, and all 4 levels of color highlighting would work (as opposed to just stderr/stdout). Still, keep the code for catching error/warning outputs around, as it might be useful in the future (e.g, if we chose to send error/warning messages to Slicer).

Ah! I just saw your message Andras.

If you don't mind, I will leave it as is for you to explore. It is working well at the moment, and could be easily extended in the future. It supports 3 color catching of messages as well as an optional prefix for differentiating sources of log messages. It also handles normal and abnormal server exiting.

Having PlusServer launched as a separate process from PlusServerLauncher has a couple of advantages, so it's good that you've implemented it. Is it ready for testing?

re #967: Made PlusServer quit if console window is closed

Qt cannot send SIGINT (ctrl-c) events on Windows, only on Linux/Mac. On Windows it sends WM_CLOSE to all windows of the process instead. (http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qprocess.html#terminate)
To allow PlusServerLauncher to stop PluServer, we make the PlusServer application quit if if its console receives WM_CLOSE.

Commit: r:4028|plus:4028

#### 2015-03-04, 19:19:35 - Andras Lasso
@rankin Server process launching looks nice and works well except the termination by sending special commands to the process stdin.

I've changed the PlusServer to exit on QProcess:terminate (on linux/mac this generates SIGINT = ctrl-c, which we already observe; on Windows it generates WM_CLOSE that now we observe).

Please remove the command sending/receiving through stdin and simply use QProcess::terminate instead.

Thanks for reporting this.

You can build an installation package by running CreatePackage.bat (this is done every night, runs with the current version of the code), so I'm wondering why you have this error.

Which step of the build process failed with the above error?
Have you changed any default build option?

By default  vtkVolumeReconstruction is built as a DLL and therefore it is a 'runtime' target.
If vtkVolumeReconstruction is built as a static library (lib) then it is an 'archive' target but then it should not be installed with the application at all (because it is unnecessary, as it is already linked into the 'runtime' components).

#### 2015-04-03, 19:00:19 - Dzenan Zukic
I have changed some options (enabled modules for devices I want), but I don't remember changing static/dynamic options. After this fix, I am running into some compile and link errors concerning linkage. Maybe I should delete CMake cache and re-build it. I will post an update.

I am building it in Release mode now. Once it gets to PlusLib, it will automatically update it. I doubt it will stop building with this change. But instead of hinting with ${TELEMED_SDK_DIR}/include/USGFWSDK/include, you should hint with ${TELEMED_SDK_DIR} or with both.

#### 2015-04-07, 00:44:32 - Andras Lasso
TELEMED_SDK_DIR does not exist, nothing sets it.
FindTelemed.cmake only sets TELEMED_INCLUDE_DIR, which is not used throughout PlusBuild and PlusLib.

#### 2015-04-07, 02:05:52 - Dzenan Zukic
I thought there is only one Telemed path var, TELEMED_INCLUDE_DIR. I meant that, not TELEMED_SDK_DIR.

#### 2015-04-08, 15:10:25 - Dzenan Zukic
The release build was successful.

Additional note for RelWithDebInfo. After copying the DLLs, fCal would start but would not automatically find 'Device set configuration directory'. Release had no problem with that. Once I copied the path from Release to RelWithDebInfo, it stopped producing the error message.

#### 2015-04-09, 12:28:30 - Andras Lasso
The default configuration file directory it's stored in PlusConfig.xml. A default PlusConfig.xml is copied to Debug and Release directories but not to the other two configurations. I've added a note to #980 about it.

## #980 RelWithDebInfo is a second-class citizen
RelWithDebInfo build mode lacks SEIDrv32.dll and ATC3DG.DLL. These files are present in Debug and Release folders (along with Qt's DLLs and PlusConfig.xml), in spite of me never even building in either of these modes.

#### 2015-04-07, 00:54:30 - Andras Lasso
DLLs are copied to bin/Debug bin/Release directories to avoid the need to use a launcher. This should be done for MinSizeRel and RelWithDebugInfo configurations, too.

As a workaround, you can copy all the DLLs in Release to RelWithDebugInfo.

#### 2015-04-07, 14:45:45 - Andras Lasso
Note for final solution: Copying all Qt DLLs to two additional directories would waste a lot of disk space. Use a custom target/command to copy DLLs to bin. That would allow populating only those directories that the developer actually wants to use.

#### 2015-04-09, 12:25:18 - Andras Lasso
Copy also PlusConfig.xml

## #981 Building Telemed support properly
To build Plus with support for Telemed's device, I had to make the attached changes.

I assume there will be more work, because fCal is crashing if I try to connect to the device. Should I keep adding patches to this ticket, or start new tickets?

@dzenan.zukic829177:
I would suggest to use #505 until a first working version of vtkTelemedVideoSource is ready.
I've added you write access to the repository, so you can commit Telemed related changes (such as the patch suggested above) directly to the repository. I'll comment on the committed code if I have any suggestion.
There is a simple standalone test for the Telemed interface (vtkTelemedVideoSourceTest), I would suggest to make that work first and then start testing with fCal.

We have just received a Telemed ultrasound yesterday, so we too we'll be able to test the interface.

re #982: Set default image orientation for Thorlabs device
Commit: r:4134|plus:4134


## #983 Example configuration files for Telemed are outdated
Running fCal with default configuration file for Telemed scanner produces the below output in the console window. The other configuration file produces the same errors.

Matthieu Heitz, who committed the original support for Telemed last year says it worked back then. Therefore the reason is almost certainly some changes in PlusLib done since. To get it to compile, for example, frame size needed to be changed from 2D to 3D (the third dimension ==1). vtkTelemedVideoSourceTest is running correctly.

Plus Server requires OpenIGTLinkServer element. See description and example here:

#### 2015-04-10, 21:42:56 - Dzenan Zukic
PlusOpenIGTLinkServer node is already in the configuration file. When attempting to connect from Slicer, it results in WAIT status.

#### 2015-04-10, 21:52:15 - Andras Lasso
Make sure PlusServer is let through the firewall. You can try to disable the firewall temporarily to confirm that it causes the connection issue.

#### 2015-04-10, 21:54:08 - Andras Lasso
By the way, the log that you attached is generated by fCal. Run PlusServer or PlusServerLauncher to start an OpenIGTLink server.

#### 2015-04-10, 21:56:40 - Dzenan Zukic
Both the fCal and Slicer are on localhost. Turning the firewall off makes no difference.

Does PlusServer need to be running in addition to fCal?

fCal is only needed for ultrasound calibration. Use PlusServer for streaming data through OpenIGTLink.

#### 2015-04-10, 22:12:38 - Andras Lasso
PlusServerLauncher has a convenient GUI, you can use that instead of the console app PlusServer.

Follow these steps to see the live image in Slicer:
http://perk-software.cs.queensu.ca/plus/doc/nightly/user/ProcedureStreamingToSlicer.html

#### 2015-04-13, 15:50:09 - Dzenan Zukic
I followed the instructions, but VolumeResliceDriver does not help - I still don't see the ultrasound image in Slicer. All 3 windows (R, Y, G) are all black.

The capturing step in fCal is displaying the ultrasound image now, I guess adding those fCal and Rendering elements to configuration file made a difference.

## #985 Improve PlusServerLauncher status display
When clicking 'Connect' button in PlusServerLauncher it quickly displays 'Connection successful!' status, while it only successfully started the server. Instead, display 'Server is started' message and query the status of the launched PlusServer and display detailed status (e.g., 'Connecting to devices', 'Connection successful', 'Server is stopped'). As multiple OpenIGTLinkServer can run in a single PlusServer process, status could be displayed for each instance.

It could be also useful to show server log messages in a separate log window to make it more easily accessible, not mixed with the server's logs. Maybe the best would be to put it in a collapsible section at the bottom of the main window.

It could be also useful to show server host name/IP address in the window (currently it is only logged and if there are many log messages then it is difficult to find it).

test #985 Reworked log parsing in PlusServerLauncher to be more robust.

PlusServerLauncher now requests max(LOG_LEVEL_INFO, requestedLevel) so that it can always parse necessary info level text. Does not show any log items below requestedLevel to the user, only parses them internally.

Server now parses incoming log messages to behave more intelligently. It analyzes used port output and presents that to the user. It also looks for the key message 'Press Ctrl-C to quit' to indicate that the server is up and running.

Awesome! Instead of ctrl-c it would be nice to log a more specific message and look for that (e.g.: Server status: DataCollection=active, NumberOfConnectedClients=0). It could be used in the future for conveying other information as well (for example number of connected clients). The message could be logged by PlusServer at debug or info level.

#### 2015-10-28, 00:51:54 - Adam Rankin
Definitely, we can make the log parsing as intelligent as we want. It is very easy to add a new check.

It is all handled by ParseContent

## #987 Improve invalid tool state in vtkOpenIGTLinkTracker
If vtkOpenIGTLinkTracker receives TRANSFORM or POSITION messages for a tool for a while it may mean that the tool is out of view, which is a normal situation for optical trackers. However, the vtkOpenIGTLinkTracker considers this an error instead of just setting the tool status to invalid for the time intervals it did not receive updates.

A new operating mode should be added: in that new mode vtkOpenIGTLinkTracker::InternalUpdate would wait for a transform from all the tools, and if it does not get update from a particular tool, it would make its status invalid. This is how most physical trackers work and it would allow getting rid of warning messages that are logged when a tool is out of view.

re #988: Replaced old Telemed interface by current one

Several old COM interfaces did not work anymore (setting frequency, depth, etc). Imaging now works (without the need of starting the EchoWave software), but further improvements are needed (add support for setting more parameters, etc).

IDL compiler output (Usgfw2*.*) are added directly. It would be nicer to generate this files using CMake.

Regarding IDL compiler output, the file \\PlusLib\\src\\DataCollection\\CMakeLists.txt already contains the required command (I added it earlier), it just needs to be un-commented:


~~~~

  # ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND(OUTPUT 
  # Telemed/Usgfw2_h.h
  # Telemed/dlldata.c
  # Telemed/Usgfw2_i.c
  # Telemed/Usgfw2_p.c
    # COMMAND midl.exe /out ./Telemed /header Usgfw2_h.h /no_robust ${TELEMED_INCLUDE_DIR}/Usgfw2.idl
  # )


~~~~


I don't remember any more whether the generated files are identical to the ones provided by Telemed.

## #996 Reduce artifacts in reconstruction of multi-sweep volumes
When reconstructing a volume from multiple sweeps, dark stripe artifacts may appear in the image where the sweeps overlap.

## #1002 Recording frame rate is low
Reported by Andriy Fedorov (BWH): I have total number of frames 332 and the timestamps go from 568 to 615, which I interpret as 7 fps, while  AcquisitionRate was set to '30'

re #1002: fCal uses RequestedFrameRate for deciding what is the maximum possible recording rate. Only log 'Recording of frames takes too long time' message as warning if the recording starts to lag more than 1sec. BaseFilename attribute is used by fCal. Made canceling of recording faster.

Commit: r:4192|plus:4192

#### 2015-06-13, 12:37:07 - Andras Lasso
Try these settings (in the capture device):


* FrameBufferSize='200' (frames are stored in memory and when the buffer is full the contents is written to disk)
* RequestedFrameRate='30' (maximum 30 frames are recorded per second)
* AcquisitionRate='8' (Plus checks for new frames to write 8 times per second)
* BaseFilename='......mhd' (use a file name with .mhd extension to get rid of the post-processing time of merging the temporary header and pixel data file into a single file)

See the user manual for some notes on crossbar usage: http://perk-software.cs.queensu.ca/plus/doc/nightly/user/DeviceMicrosoftMediaFoundation.html

#### 2015-06-17, 14:34:28 - Adam Rankin
Would a crossbar show up as a single device in device manager? I have two USB webcams in device manager.

#### 2015-06-17, 15:15:23 - Andras Lasso
It might be an issue that some initialization steps are allowed to be done only in each process (I'm not sure if there are any steps like this). We might consider allowing one vtkMmfVideoSource class connect to multiple hardware devices (and send the output on multiple channels). It would have the limitation though that currently we use the same acquisition rate for all channels in a device, so in some cases it may not be ideal.

#### 2015-06-17, 15:17:20 - Andras Lasso
My understanding is that a crossbar is for selecting between different input channels. You can only acquire image from one channel at a time. Probably Vuzix does not use a crossbar, as it uses both channels in parallel.

#### 2015-06-17, 15:37:06 - Andras Lasso
It could be interesting to try if you can connect to both hardware devices if you start two PlusServer instances and connect to one device from each.

## #1005 Delay-load device-specific DLLs
Some devices rely on various driver DLLs that are installed in system directories. If those DLLs are not installed then none of the Plus application start. Using delayed DLL loading the driver DLLs would not be required unless that specific device is used that requires that DLL.

https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/151kt790(v=vs.90).aspx

Offending devices:
- Interson US
- Telemed US
- Thorlabs spectrometer
- MicronTracker (on WinXP embedded)

This would mean that a single package could be used on all configurations. Multiple packages would be still needed to cover different SDK versions (Ultrasonix and MicronTracker) and Win32/Win64.

## #1008 Allow dynamic change of image clipping rectangle
Allow changing of image clipping rectangle dynamically, without restarting Plus. See this discussion: https://www.assembla.com/spaces/plus/messages/5076633

Implementation notes: Changing the frame buffer size would be problematic for many reasons, including possible out-of-memory errors when allocating memory for larger images, not being able to save frames of different size into metafiles (image size is constant throughout), accessing frames while switching between frame sizes. Therefore, probably we would need to allocate the maximum frame size and provide additional information about the current extent.

re #1010: Pass Qt5_DIR to external projects instead of overriding CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH

CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH is a variable that affects all find_... operations. To avoid potential side effects, instead of passing CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH just pass the found QT5..._DIR variables.
Commit: r:4724|plus:4724

#### 2016-07-13, 16:12:08 - Adam Rankin
Hmm, could we discuss this? CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH is the correct way to locate the Qt5 packages. Perhaps we could append the prefix path?

#### 2016-07-13, 16:15:57 - Andras Lasso
You can still use either CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or Qt5_DIR to specify to PlusBuild where Qt5 is located, but then PlusBuild sends the necessary directories to the external projects (VTK and PlusApp).

re #1010: Cleaned up Qt5 finding a bit more

Get QT5..._DIR variables from find_package.
Only pass Qt5WebKitWidgets_DIR if Qt version &lt;5.6.0 (as it is removed in Qt 5.6.0).
Removed unused QT_ROOT_DIR.

Please don't add a new feature for this. We already have arbitrary unit support and use it for example for pixel and mm. If you need tool position in meters then just define a transform that converts between Tracker and TrackerMeter (which is a simple diag(1000, 1000, 1000, 1) matrix).

re #1010: Fine-tuned ndicapi dependency

NDI common api and oapi are two completely different interfaces, so decoupled them.
If external ndicapi_DIR is provided then don't add a dependency (PlusBuild will not know how to build it).

It was a new way to cmake-ifiy imported library targets. I'd like to see if there's a way to attach multiple DLLs to a single target, but so far I can't find it.

#### 2017-05-26, 02:31:44 - Adam Rankin
With this way, all of the logic for finding, using and installing is in the find module.

#### 2017-05-26, 02:36:09 - Andras Lasso
People who use PlusLib only (not use PlusBuild) would have a harder time with the new way. They would need to get those CMake modules and put it in their project, keep in sync with PlusBuild. I would rather spend time with improvements that have clear, significant advantages (then I don't mind if there are slight disadvantages).

#### 2017-05-26, 02:40:44 - Adam Rankin
Hmm, fair enough. Do PlusLib devices work if PlusBuild isn't used? Would people need to manually populate MicronTracker_LIBRARY... etc?

#### 2017-05-26, 02:57:26 - Andras Lasso
Yes, they do, they just need to set the include dirs, library names, etc. according to where these are available in their project (not necessarily in PLTools).

re #1010: Always build ndicapi

ndicapi library is changing relatively frequently, which breaks the build until a a rebuild is triggered manually.

ndicapi can be built quickly, so overall it is better to force to build it every time (at least for now, when changes are quite frequent).

## #1011 PlusServerLauncher is built when BUILD_TESTING is enabled
As per description here: url:https://www.assembla.com/spaces/plus/messages/5249553|https://www.assembla.com/spaces/plus/messages/5249553




~~~~

When BUILD_TESTING is not enabled, it doesn't build PlusServer, but PlusServerLauncher still tries to start the process, however logging does not tell exactly what could be the issue.
It would be good to notify the user, if the plusServerExecutable file does not exist (in bool PlusServerLauncherMainWindow::startServer), or build PlusServer executable even if BUILD_TESTING is off.

Here is the output from the log using Plus 2.2 branch:
|ERROR|005.483000| Server process error: FailedToStart| in ..\\..\\PlusApp\\PlusServerLauncher\\PlusServerLauncherMainWindow.cxx(326)

@lassoan it seems to me that the correct behavior is that PlusServer should be build regardless of BUILD_TESTING or not.

It seems to me like the Cmake files should be modified to not configure the tests if BUILD_TESTING is disabled.

Thoughts?

#### 2015-08-31, 15:50:45 - Andras Lasso
I agree that executables that don't start with vtk prefix (PlusServer, EditSeqMetafile, etc.) are not test applications, so they should not depend on BUILD_TESTING flag. It might still make sense to add a BUILD_TOOLS ('applications' would be confusing because of PlusApp) option to not build any executables if somebody just needs libraries.

re #1011 Improving detection of PLUS targets in downstream CMake projects by automatically including necessary include dirs as properties on targets
Commit: r:4695|plus:4695


## #1012 Multi device broadcasting with vtkPlusOpenIGTLinkserver
Device specific data broadcasting would be a great addition to vtkPlusOpenIGTLink interface. 

Requirements: 
- Allow connection to new devices when new PlusCommand request arrived from a client and there is no connection yet (Need access to DataCollector devices, requires new PlusCommand)
- Allow connection from a new client to an already connected device (Requires device specific ClientData list and TransformRepository)

Here is a scenario:
Client1 need data from Device1 Channel1 -> Send request to connect to to Device1 and transfer data from Channel1 
Client2 connected and request data from Device1 Channel1 -> We use the already connected Device1 Channel1 stream 
Client2 connected and request data from Device1 Channel2 -> Maybe define new channel (Channel2) on Device1 if it's possible and start broadcasting
Client3 connected and request data from Device2 Channel1 -> Send request to connect to to Device2 and transfer data from Channel1 
Client1 need data from Device2 Channel1 -> We use the already connected Device2 Channel1 stream 

#### 2015-07-09, 20:02:00 - Andras Lasso
You can create multiple OpenIGTLinkServer elements in the config file, one for each output channel, with different port numbers. So, any client could get any data stream at any time without the need of dynamically changing connections or adding new devices.

We also plan to add a command that allows you to (re)start PlusServer with an arbitrary config file, without any user interaction (#858). It'll be possible to run PlusServerLauncher as background service and whenever a client sends a config file to PlusServerLauncher, it'll start a PlusServer instance with that config file. There'll be command for starting/stopping/restarting a PlusServer instance.

Are these existing/planned features are going to fulfil your needs?

#### 2015-07-09, 21:29:35 - Tamas Heffter
I'm working on a similar design, a windows service running always in the background and waiting for clients to connect. The client can request to start different processes (like fCal) or connect to devices based on configuration command received (xml data sent as a string). I just want to avoid using multiple port numbers and creating new connections for each device connection to simplify the design (so I don't need multiple sockets for each client). Also, with this design, I cannot define the OpenIGTLink server elements in advance, it needs to be dynamic (it might run for very long time). 
#858 might solve my problem, but again, you would have multiple PlusServer instances for each device configs and I'm not sure you can easily handle 2 client with the same device access (like 2 clients want to connect to  the Touch and/or Ascension tracker with their own config files). 

#### 2015-07-10, 01:05:09 - Andras Lasso
One PlusServer instance can already handle any number of output channels. Just specify one OpenIGTLinkServer element in the configuration file. The only thing that is not supported is outputting multiple channels on the same socket (we don't plan to support this because it is more efficient and more robust to have a separate socket for each output channel),

We'll make the PlusServerLauncher able to receive OpenIGTLink commands for starting/stopping PlusServer instances. It's already partially implemented; it's a lightweight process that can start and stop a PlusServer instance manually, just the network interface has to be added. The application can be added to the Windows startup processes and can be started minimized. Running it is a Windows service is a lot of extra hassle (install, uninstall, authentication, deal with limitations due to running without a desktop, etc) without much benefits (actually, I'm bout sure what benefits it would have).

#### 2015-07-10, 01:10:31 - Andras Lasso
By the way, there are services already available that allow you to start a process on a remote computer:

@lassoan I don't mind taking care of this. Do you have a preference?

#### 2015-08-31, 14:56:23 - Adam Rankin
I vote PLUS_USE_NDI because users don't need to know what a C api is... only what devices are involved.

#### 2015-08-31, 15:01:35 - Andras Lasso
OK. Use PLUS_USE_NDI and PLUS_USE_NDI_CERTUS names (Certus is not used very often and most people don't know what we mean by common API).

Add a few lines of code to log a CMake warning (that the option is deprecated) and enable PLUS_USE_POLARIS if PLUS_USE_NDI is specified and PLUS_USE_NDI_CERTUS if PLUS_USE_CERTUS is enabled to remain backward compatible. We can remove those in a year.

MetaIO image multi-dimensional support is very poor. It does not even specify what each image axis mean (spatial, time, other parameter). I think we should use nrrd instead. The same kind if text file header may be used, so it's a small change in Plus. The only complication is the migration from MetaIO to NRRD - we need to support MetaIO for 1-2 years at least and provide conversion facility in Edit Seq Metafile.


## #1015 Use NRRD instead of MetaIO image for file IO
MetaIO image limitations:
* no required patient position field (there are some fields bit itk/vtk readers ignore it, as it is a hint only)
* no specification of coordinate axes types (spatial, time, other parameter)
* flawed high-dimensional data support (if we specify a 4D image then we need to provide origin, orientation in 4D; kind of always assume that all dimensions are spatial)

Advantages of MetaIO would be the storage of meshes, but we've never needed this.

Other potential advantage of MetaIO would have been the smaller MetaIO library, but the quality of the library is not good (overdesigned, yet limited and very slow; that's why we needed to implement the reader/writer from scratch).

re #1015: Added support for deprecated SequenceMetafile attribute (logs warning to notify the user about the attribute name change). It is important for supporting replay of old recordings and using of existing training materials with latest Plus version.

Also turned off compressed saving by default, as it may impact recording significantly on slower computers.

Renamed boolean attribute values to all uppercase. When config files are written they are normalized to uppercase anyway. We use upppercase for enumerated values everywhere, so it's more consistent. Plus still understands any kind of capitalization for booleans (true, True, TRUE).

Fixed build warnings.

> What would be the easiest way of sending parameters to the vtkOptimetConoProbe device (from e.g. Slicer), in order to adjust parameters of the device during runtime?

Add a new vtkPlusCommand class. Command classes in Plus can read/write the command from/to XML (that Plus sends as an OpenIGTLink string message) and can execute an operation and generate response(s). You can start from this command as an example PlusLib\\src\\PlusServer\\vtkPlusStartStopRecordingCommand.

Hello @nenetto,

Thank you for your work integrating your library!

I noticed that a config file with some local changes was checked in to the main repository. If you'd like to have local changes persist in the repository, could you add an institution subfolder and make a copy in there?

I meant that, if you have a file that has folders or concepts specific to your experiments, you could create PlusLibData/ConfigFiles/<YourInstitution>/abcd.xml

#### 2016-03-03, 21:45:50 - Adam Rankin
Data will now be found under trunk/PlusLibData instead of trunk/PlusLib/data after I check in some changes soon.


## #1019 Add tool status display widget to PlusServerLauncher
It would be nice if we had the same tool state display widget that is in fCal available in the PlusServerLauncher

#### 2015-07-29, 16:54:49 - Andras Lasso
PlusServerLauncher is not in the same process anymore, it just launches a server, so it's not that easy to implement. It may connect to the server to get tool info, but there could be multiple streams, there are various ways how to indicate invalid tool status (depending on OpenIGTLink message type, SendValidTransformsOnly, etc.), so it would not be very simple.

#### 2015-07-29, 20:16:55 - Adam Rankin
Ah yes, I just went through the code and came to this realization. Nevermind this request, it was a 'nice-to-have' anyways.

I think I have most of the elements of the solution in the attached zip file. All notes are available as comments in their corresponding files. You can find them by searching for # Siavash.

This zip file includes the following files:

1. CMakeLists.txt. This is the top level PlusBuild CMakeLists.txt, i.e. *PlusExperimental-build/CMakeLists.txt*. I only made two minor changes to this file:

1.a Line 77 added, 


~~~~


OPTION(PLUSBUILD_USE_QT5 'Plus uses QT5 instead of QT4' ON)


~~~~


1.b Lines 199-226: Added an if-statement to find Qt5 and Qt4 depending on PLUSBUILD_USE_QT5 switch.

Notes: I am unsure how to properly find Qt5, the path is hard-coded at the moment in line 201. Also, I did not find a similar expression to *QT4_FOUND* for *Qt5*, i.e. *IF(NOT QT5_FOUND)* --> Display error message.

2. External_VTK.cmake: This is the same as *PlusExperimental-build/External_VTK.cmake*. I only made three minor changes to this file:
2.a. Line 35 added, 


~~~~


OPTION(PLUSBUILD_USE_QT5 'Plus uses QT5 instead of QT4' ON)


~~~~


2.b Line 47 and 48, added Qt5 version specific arguments.


~~~~


SET(VTK_VERSION_SPECIFIC_ARGS ${VTK_VERSION_SPECIFIC_ARGS}
    -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:STRING=C:/Qt/5.5.0/qt-5.5.0-x64-msvc2013-rev0/lib/cmake/
    -DVTK_QT_VERSION:STRING=5
    )


~~~~


Notes: I am not sure how to pass PLUSBUILD_USE_QT5 from item 1 to External_VTK.cmake, and I am not sure how to pass CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH properly.

3. PlusLib.patch. Only one minor change, I added a convinience macro, i.e.:


~~~~


#define QT_MAJOR_VERSION @VTK_QT_VERSION@


~~~~


4. PlusApp.patch: (these changes are Qt4 compatible)
4.a Changed *FIND_PACKAGE(Qt)* according to the right version in CMakeLists.txt files.
4.b Changed *#include <QtGui/QApplication>* to *#include <QApplication>*
4.c Changed *QString::fromAscii* to *QString::fromLatin1*
4.d Changed *Qt::WFlags* to *Qt::WindowFlags*

Notes:
4.x I did not manage to set COMPILE_FLAGS '/Zc:wchar_t-' for CommonWidgets in CMake. I had to change it manually in project properties.
4.y fCal does not build in release mode for me. I get the following error:

1>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\Microsoft.Cpp\\v4.0\\V120\\Microsoft.CppCommon.targets(1267,5): warning MSB6002: The command-line for the 'RC' task is too long.

Adam, there is a Qt5 specific problem for project deployment. When I deploy my own application, which is developed on top of Plus, and try to run it on the production PC for testing, I get the following error:

_This application failed to start because it could not find or load the Qt platform plugin 'windows'.
Reinstalling the application may fix this problem._

I suspect that you will have the same problem for fCal when you migrate to Qt5. You can solve this problem by adding *qwindows.dll* to the *platforms* directory that is created in your bin directory. In this case, your deployment directory will look like this:


~~~~



/YourAppInstallFolder
  - YourApp.exe
  - any needed Qt DLLs
     -/platforms
        - qwindows.dll

Adam, I did not manage to get *SET(CMAKE_AUTOMOC ON)* working for CMake. The documentation is confusing. But you can follow the same set of rules as Qt4, i.e. 


~~~~


QT4_WRAP_CPP( fCal_QT_MOC_Files ${fCal_UI_HDRS} )        
QT4_WRAP_UI( fCal_QT_UI_Headers ${fCal_UI_SRCS} )
QT4_WRAP_CPP( fCal_QT_MOC_UI_Files ${fCal_QT_UI_Headers} )
QT4_ADD_RESOURCES( fCal_QT_RCC_Files ${fCal_QT_Resources} )


~~~~


becomes:


~~~~


QT5_WRAP_CPP( fCal_QT_MOC_Files ${fCal_UI_HDRS} )        
QT5_WRAP_UI( fCal_QT_UI_Headers ${fCal_UI_SRCS} )
QT5_WRAP_CPP( fCal_QT_MOC_UI_Files ${fCal_QT_UI_Headers} )
QT5_ADD_RESOURCES( fCal_QT_RCC_Files ${fCal_QT_Resources} )


~~~~


Also, you can change *Qt::WFlags* to *Qt:WindowFlags*, which works for Qt4.8 as well.

I've tested it with both qt 4 and 5. I got rc.exe errors on vs2012 due to long command-line (with qt4 I get it only for PlusServerLauncher, with qt5 I get it for all qt Plus applications). I have to investigate this and test packaging before integration.

fixed #1026: Improved support for motorized probes

* setting up motor resolution/speed and range now works for both SDK 5.x and 6.x

* motor position computation is much more robust (previously the motor position was obtained by counting the frames and incrementing the angle, which  may not be correct if there are skipped frames and also the initial value may be shifted by a couple of frames; now the angle is computed from the stepper motor position information in the frame header)

* probe motor geometry is queried from the probe (previously it had to be set manually in the config file)

* scan conversion parameters are queried from the SDK - this allows computation of all intrinsic calibration parameters and calibrating at one imaging depth and using that at any other depths

## #1029 Allow setting ROM file for wired NDI tracker tools
A broken active (wired) NDI tool may be fixed by setting the ROM from file. Currently Plus ignores the ROM file if a PortName is specified. Change this to allow setting ROM even for wired tools. See details at https://www.assembla.com/spaces/plus/messages/5255553.

## #1033 Add option to build Plus without internet connection
Ultrasonix US machines use Windows XP embedded OS, and IT cut them off from internet. It is still convenient to build Plus there for debugging, but there are build errors due to missing SVN information and there are problems reported due to failed repository updates.

## #1036 CMake error when configuring current Plus source
Configuring the current Plus superbuild results in a CMake error in External_PlusApp.cmake: 

CMake Error at External_PlusApp.cmake:63 (STRING):
  string end index: 4 is out of range -1 - 3
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:492 (INCLUDE)

The problem occurs when the substring between character 1 and ${CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_LENGTH} is trying to be extracted because ${CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_LENGTH} exceeds the length of the string as a character position. Using ${CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_LENGTH}-1 instead seems to solve the problem.

My configuration here:

Win7 64 bit
Visual Studio 2010 64 bit
CMake 2.8.12.2

## #1040 Wrong definition of FrameSize in vtkForoughiBoneSurfaceProbability
The frame size in the vtkForoughiBoneSurfaceProbability is currently defined as:
    this->FrameSize[0] = inputExtent[1]-inputExtent[0];
    this->FrameSize[1] = inputExtent[3]-inputExtent[2];
Doing so the buffers used for Gaussian, LaplacianOfGaussian, ReflectionNumber, and ShadowValue differ in size from the inputSlicePtr and outputSlicePtr leading to artifacts in the calculation (see attached screenshots).

This can be fixed by correctly defining the FrameSize:
    this->FrameSize[0] = inputExtent[1]-inputExtent[0]+1;
    this->FrameSize[1] = inputExtent[3]-inputExtent[2]+1;

A patch containing this solution is attached as well.

## #1041 Grey border on Telemed ultrasound images
A gray border is visible on both sides of Telemed ultrasound images. Gray value is 85. Width depends on the image aspect ratio (DepthMm parameter).

Probably related to this in TelemedUltrasound.cxx:

    tagPALETTEENTRY clr1;
    clr1.peRed    = 0;
    clr1.peGreen  = 0;
    clr1.peBlue    = 255;
    clr1.peFlags  = 0;
    m_mixer_control->put_BkColor(clr1);

/*
    // repaint ultrasound (important if we are in freeze)
    HDC hdc = ::GetDC(m_usg_wnd);

* Fixed return filename in start/stop recording command (works well even if the filename is overridden).
* Cleaned up relative path handling (removed relative path handling from vtkSequenceIO level, done at higher levels, for example capture device)

Commit: r:4372|plus:4372

#### 2015-09-30, 14:30:34 - Andras Lasso
Thanks for working on this. Having a GUI for selecting editor application is very useful. However, the way it is implemented now makes the application more difficult to use.

Editing a config file is needed hundreds of times more than selecting an editor application. We should keep config file editing a single-click operation. It's enough if editor selection is available as a right-click, long-press, etc. action.

Manual editor selection is useful, but you still have to select it after each Plus installation. In addition to this it would be nice to use the default editor if no editor is selected (we could initialize editor application to '' instead of 'notepad.exe'). You can invoke default editor like this:

#include <QDesktopServices>
#include <QUrl> 
...
QDesktopServices::openUrl(QUrl('file:///'+myFileName, QUrl::TolerantMode));

We should have used the default editor in the first place, but we did not know at that time that it is so easy to implement.

## #1048 Add an option to not consider missing frames as error if ultrasound system is frozen
On Ultrasonix systems the operator may freeze the acquisition on the ultrasound and then Plus does not receive any new images. This may be an error in some cases (when the operator is not expected to freeze the images at any time) or a normal scenario. Error should only be logged if freezing is unexpected. See details at: https://www.assembla.com/spaces/plus/messages/5400753

Possible fix: Add an option for vtkSonixVideoSource (ReportFreezeDuringRecordingAsError, 'TRUE' by default) to report/not report errors if freeze is activated during recording. Also, add an option for vtkPlusOpenIGTLinkServer (ReportMissingInputAsError, 'TRUE' by default) to report/not report errors if input is not received. To allow freeze: both reporting would need to be set to FALSE and tracking data should be probably sent through a different channel (one channel would contain only the tracked image data, the other channel would contain all other tracked tools)

Once implementation of metadata in OpenIGTLink v3 is implemented, I can implement meta-data related feature sending.

As of now, this is simply PLUS server as it was, but communicating in IGTLv3, and IGTLv2/v1 if it receives commands of that generation.

#### 2016-01-15, 03:10:24 - Adam Rankin
Further work on the specification is needed to continue implementation.

re #1057 Significant implementation towards OpenIGTLink v3 support.

Using changes to igtl::MessageFactory to remove direct reference to string message types, instead using RTTI information of the classes produced by the factory. This transfers all ownership of string to message type lookup to OpenIGTLink.

## #1061 Add a new tracker device to support multiple US digital A2 encoders
Add a new tracker device (vtkUSDigitalA2EncodersTracker) to support multiple US digital A2 encoders in vtkDataCollection.

Here is the design goal of the new tracker device:
 1) Communication with multiple encoders (US Digital A2 type) with SEI interface.
 2) Acquire encoder values from multiple connected encoders.
 3) Combine acquired encoder values and generate one representative transformation matrix based on user-defined configuration.

Also add a following test code and configuration XML file.

Minor comment, I would recommend a more flexible name since the software API supports the A2, A2K, A2T and HD25A encoders.

Perhaps

vtkUSDigitalEncoderSEITracker

#### 2016-01-14, 18:44:31 - Andras Lasso
Or just vtkUSDigitalEncoderTracker. It can be specified in the documentation what exact protocols and devices it supports.

#### 2016-01-14, 18:46:40 - Hyun Jae Kang
Thank Adam for your comment, 

I think 'vtkUSDigitalEncoderSEITracker ' is good name for the new class. I will change the class name.

Could you give me some information of matrix-operation/transformation-matrix(4x4) operation within PlusLib?

And, I have another question.
Can we change the order of transformation conversion with XML configuration?

For example, there are three transformation matrix T1, T2, T3. 
And then,  Can we generate the following final transformation matrix based on a user-defined XML configuration,?
Case 1) T_out = T1 x T2 x T3
Case 2) T_out = T2 x T1 x T3
Case 3) T_out = T3 X T1 x T2

This class will support multiple encoder and each encoder will provide a movement/rotation according to a specific coordinate. Finally, one representative transformation matrix will be computed with the acquired and calculated multiple sub-transformation.

If possible, I would like to implement the above function with reconfigurable based on a XML configuration.


#### 2016-01-14, 18:54:55 - Adam Rankin
PlusLib uses vtkMatrix4x4 for it's transformation storage.

Depending on the interface of the API, if you poll the devices for data, then look into vtkPlusDevice::InternalUpdate. If the API provides a callback, then InternalUpdate is not needed (unless for other reasons).

To record a transform to a tool data source, look into vtkPlusDevice::ToolTimeStampedUpdate

You can store anything you like in XML. Look into vtkPlusDevice::ReadConfiguration and vtkPlusDevice::WriteConfiguration. A configuration file is typically set up by the user (or the engineer supporting the user) or provided by you, the author!

For helpful examples, look at vtkNDITracker or vtkAscension3DGTrackerBase to learn from!

#### 2016-01-14, 18:55:12 - Adam Rankin
Both of those devices are polling-based acquisition.

#### 2016-01-14, 19:04:12 - Hyun Jae Kang
Thanks for your helpful comments.

#### 2016-01-14, 19:21:55 - Andras Lasso
Transforms are automatically concatenated and inverted as needed. You just have to specify a unique name for each coordinate system you have and then each transform is defined by specifying from what to what coordinate system it transforms. Tracker tools so far use a common coordinate system name, but (AToTracker, BToTracker, etc) but we can change that to be able to specify arbitrary 'To' and 'From' names.

#### 2016-01-14, 19:53:41 - Hyun Jae Kang
Thanks Andras for your helpful comments.

Could you give me some information about which class or code will be good for me to understand about the Transformation-chain. I found the class of 'PlusTransformName'. But, I am still looking for real matrix operation part within PlusLib. 



#### 2016-01-14, 20:13:47 - Adam Rankin
I think what you're looking for is vtkTransformRepository

https://www.assembla.com/spaces/plus/subversion/source/HEAD/trunk/PlusLib/src/PlusCommon/vtkTransformRepository.cxx

Basically, a TrackedFrame puts all of its non-persistent transforms (typically from tracker devices) into the repository (which already contains persistent transforms, such as calibrations) and then the repository will then provide any transform you wish so long as it can be computed (by inverting known transforms, chaining transforms together, etc...)

This is not something you will have to manage though. By providing the correct config file syntax (data source for a tool/tools) and using ToolTimeStampedUpdate all of this is managed for you.

## #1062 Create UI for Edit Sequence File


#### 2016-01-15, 22:53:55 - Andras Lasso
We plan to create a Slicer module for this. Of course, it could be still useful to have a small, standalone application that does simple editing (but it'll be hard to resist the temptation to spend a lot of time with keep adding small features to it).

#### 2016-01-15, 23:35:35 - Adam Rankin

## #1063 Add a new interface vtkCapistranoVideoSource for updating US imaging parameters of Capistrano Ultrasound probe in on-line
Add a new interface to vtkCapistranoVideoSource for updating US imaging parameters of Capistrano Ultrasound probe in on-line

-  New US imaging parameters can be get with standard input stream (stdin)  from the console window or string from OpenIGTLink stringMessage.
    - We can add the following new function:
        PlusStatus vtkCapistranoVideoSource::UpdateUSParameters(std::string inputStream)
        {
             // Parsing the inputStream to type of imaging parameter and the associated value
             if (inputStream.find('Depth') !=std::string::npos)
             {
                  // Retrieve a new Depth value from the input Stream
                  this->SetDepth()
                  return PLUS_SUCCESS;
             } 
        }

-  Also, new US imaging parameters can be transferred with a message (?) of OpenIGTLink through TCP/IP network.



#### 2016-01-19, 15:24:05 - Hyun Jae Kang
Hi Andras and Adam,

Do you have any good idea about to update US imaging parameters with OpenIGTLink interface?

And, I am looking for a method to communicate between Slicer and PlusLib (DataCollection) by using OpenIGTLink message?
- How can I establish a bi-directional communication between Slicer and PlusLib? And, what kind of message of OpenIGTLink is available?
- Can I generate a StringMessage of OpenIGTLink in Slicer?

Please let me know.

#### 2016-01-19, 15:26:02 - Adam Rankin
Hi Hyun,

This is a very common use case and is accomplished by PlusServer. There is a convenient interface in the PlusServerLauncher application in the bin directory.

Slicer can then create a connection using the OpenIGTLinkIF module.

I am intrigued by your proposal for changing parameters via std::in. Is this so you can change probe parameters from the console running PlusServer? This is not our typical use case so I am curious as to what sorts of neat stuff you're up to!

#### 2016-01-19, 15:26:38 - Adam Rankin
To manually send strings from Slicer to PlusServer, you can use the PlusRemote module in the SlicerIGT extension. It is very mature and quite useful!

Hi Adam,

Thank you for your quick and very helpful comments.

Right now, we are not using PlusServer, but we modified one test code of vtkCapistranoVideoSource and are using it.
And, we implemented a python function within Slicer to Start/Stop the test code of vtkCapistranoVideoSource by using Python's subprocess module. This is why I need a new function for std::in.

I will check the PlusServer , Interson device and PlusRemote.

Thanks,


#### 2016-01-19, 15:56:04 - Adam Rankin
Hmmm, it might be worth building some expertise with using PlusServer. It is designed to do exactly what you are trying to do, but over OpenIGTLink instead of std::in.

Let me know if I can be of help. I will leave the ticket open to continue this discussion.

#### 2016-01-19, 21:35:59 - Andras Lasso
We plan to send string streams through OpenIGTLink to control ultrasound imaging parameters and get notifications. If you don't want to use OpenIGTLink, it's no problem, but if you want to also use string streams to set parameters then you should use the same string stream.

Our string stream is in XML string, see draft specification here: https://github.com/IGSIO/igsio.github.io

You can easily add your own parameters in addition to the most commonly used standard parameters that we've already defined.


#### 2016-01-19, 21:46:01 - Hyun Jae Kang
Thank Andras for your information.

I will check the web page and the standard parameters that you have already defined.

I have a small question about How I can use or apply the standard parameters.

Thanks,



#### 2016-01-19, 22:19:49 - Adam Rankin
It is a work in progress.

Parameters planned for management:


~~~~

Read-write
Depth
ImagingMode
Probe
Frequency
DynRange
Gain
Power
Zoom
SoundVelocity
TGC
AcquisitionState

Read-only
ClipRectangleOrigin
ClipRectangleSize
FanAnglesDeg
FanOriginPixel
FanRadiusStartPixel
FanRadiusStopPixel
Encoding


~~~~



To accomplish configuring these from std::in, you could do the following:

Send following string (example) to std::in



~~~~

<Device><UsImagingParameters><Parameter name='Depth' value='40'/><Parameter name='Gain' value='68'/></UsImagingParameters></Device>


~~~~



Then, in PlusServer, add std::in handling.
Use


~~~~

vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLDataElement> inputElement = vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLDataElement>::Take( vtkXMLUtilities::ReadElementFromString(stringFromStdIn.c_str()) );


~~~~


to convert from string to XML structure.

Then, create a new us imaging parameter via


~~~~

vtkSmartPointer<vtkUsImagingParameters> imgParam = vtkSmartPointer<vtkUsImagingParameters>::New();
imgParam ->ReadConfiguration(inputElement)


~~~~



Then, you'll have to find the device you wish to apply it to.

Get an instance of vtkPlusOpenIGTLinkServer from the variable serverList. Then grab the vtkDataCollector from that server, then request the device from that data collector, then request the channel from that device.
How you identify the server, device and channel is up to you. Perhaps parameters in the XML command?

Once it is implemented, you will be able to call:



~~~~

vtkPlusUsDevice* usDevice = vtkPlusUsDevice::SafeDown(device);
if( usDevice != NULL )
{
  usDevice->SetNewImagingParametersDevice(imgParam);
}


~~~~



However, the class vtkPlusUsDevice is not implemented yet.

## #1066 Updating the class of vtkUsImagingParameters
Hi,
 
Currently, I am working on updating ultrasound imaging parameters for Capistrano Lab Probe using an instance of vtkUsImagingParameters.
During the time, I found bug in the function of Set~~~~().

For example, we can see the function of SetIntensity() as following:

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PlusStatus vtkUsImagingParameters::SetIntensity(double aIntensity)
{
  double currentValue;
  this->GetIntensity(currentValue);
  if( this->ParameterSet[KEY_INTENSITY] == true && currentValue == aIntensity )
  {
    return PLUS_SUCCESS;
  }

  std::stringstream ss;
  ss.str(this->ParameterValues[KEY_INTENSITY]);
  ss >> aIntensity;

  this->ParameterSet[KEY_INTENSITY] = true;
  return PLUS_SUCCESS;
}

From my experience, the function does not work properly.
So, I changed the code as like:

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PlusStatus vtkUsImagingParameters::SetIntensity(double aIntensity)
{
  double currentValue;
  this->GetIntensity(currentValue);
  if( this->ParameterSet[KEY_INTENSITY] == true && currentValue == aIntensity )
  {
    return PLUS_SUCCESS;
  }

  std::stringstream ss;  
  ss << aIntensity;
  this->ParameterValues[KEY_INTENSITY] = ss.str();

  this->ParameterSet[KEY_INTENSITY] = true;
  return PLUS_SUCCESS;
}

After change, the function worked as I expected.
Is this bug? or Is there my mistakes in using the function?

Please review the code. 

If that is bug, I will update the class and commit it.

Thanks,

Hyun Jae

Thank you very much. 

#### 2016-01-21, 19:04:54 - Adam Rankin
The class is just a map, feel free to add whatever accessors you like and have them set a value in the map. The parameters listed in the standard will be officially supported, any other devices can utilize their own parameters.

If you think any of these parameters should be included in the standard, could you leave an issue at https://github.com/IGSIO/OpenIGTLink/ and we will happily discuss!

## #1069 Automatic pause of image recording
It would be nice to allow automatic pause/resume of ultrasound image recording.

Recording could be stopped when a transform status becomes invalid for a certain minimal period of time (e.g., ProbeToTracker becomes invalid for 3 seconds; it would be useful for optical tracking) or when a distance becomes too large (e.g., ProbeToReference or ProbeToNeedle transform translation component becomes larger than 300mm; could be used for EM tracking).

Alternatively, recording could be stopped when image becomes blank. A blank image could be detected as image intensity and variance at a number of predefined positions falling below a threshold value.

See discussion here: https://www.assembla.com/spaces/plus/messages/5497963

It probably makes more sense to implement this at application level. It would make manual override of start/stop recording, definition of a region of interest (outside of which recording would be stopped), and changing of filename prefixes easier.

3D visualization of tracked images and tools, volume reconstruction, registration, start/stop recording, etc. are all already freely available in SlicerIGT. Automatic start/stop feature could be implemented by adding 10-20 lines of Python code in PlusRemote module. It would not be even necessary to rebuild Slicer or any of the SlicerIGT modules.

## #1072 Class and library rename: vtkXYZ becomes vtkPlusXYZ and XYZ becomes plusXYZ
See subject.

Since Plus is starting to be used as a linked-against library, it is important to have unique names. Since we are avoiding namespacing due to python wrapping future-possibility, we must develop a consistent naming scheme for Plus classes.

@rankin We have linker issues in external projects that use Plus the trunk version. The issue is that instead of renaming files, now there are cloned files everywhere! Please remove the new files (one with the short history).

For example:

PlusLib\\src\\DataCollection\\3dConnexionTracking\\vtkPlus3dConnexionTracker.h => new file, with short history, contents should be moved to the old file then this one has to be deleted

PlusLib\\src\\DataCollection\\3dConnexionTracking\\vtk3dConnexionTracker.h  => old file, with long history, need to be renamed and the contents should be replaced with the new file's

When I use the attached config file, I can record data using PlusRemote module in Slicer with PLUS version 4412.
But when I use PLUS version 4603 (today's nightly), PlusRemote does not list the capture device. There are no error messages in PLUS or Slicer, just the CaptureDevice fails to show up.

Yes, I will investigate.

#### 2016-04-21, 20:45:44 - Adam Rankin
Confirmed it is a consequence of the renaming. Currently the devices are requested by type, to which 'vtk' is prepended and compared against the C++ class name.

@lassoan this solution won't work as there are a number of device IDs whose factory name is not the same construction as the class name. I can issue a temporary fix by prepending 'vtkPlus' instead of just 'vtk', but perhaps the factory should have a function that transforms factory name into c++ class name?

No need for any new mechanism, just make sure it works for capture and reconstructor device by updating vtkPlusRequestIdsCommand::Execute(). In the long term we probably don't want one-to-one mapping between OpenIGTLink constants and internal Plus classes.

With PLUS version 4609 the record button gets activated in PlusRemote (in Slicer), but the capture device selector dropdown menu is empty. Sometimes we have more capture devices (e.g. one that only records tracking, one for tracked images too), so the selector is required.
I tested with the same config file with PLUS version 4412 and the capture device selector gets populated. So something is still missing...

There are no error or warning messages in PLUS or Slicer, but the capture device does not show up in Slicer.

I found an older PLUS version (4367) for this hardware (Telemed 32-bit). I tried the same config file, and recording through SlicerIGT (PlusRemote module) worked perfectly.
The Slicer version I'm using is 2016-05-04. So unless SlicerIGT needs to be changed for a recent PLUS communication protocol change, as far as I can tell SlicerIGT works.

Yes, the new PLUS is sending OpenIGTLink v3 messages, and SlicerIGT is receiving them.
 
If SlicerIGT receives a v1 message, it reverts to the old behavior (aka, working).
 
The error is in SlicerIGT v3 message processing (I think, investigating…)

## #1078 Enable broadcasting of field data without transform or image data
With the text recognizer device, and possible future haptic (force) devices, there is a need to send tracked frame fields via STRING message.

Currently this is possible, but the fields must be attached to a stream buffer item with an image or transform.

Adding of fields only is required.

It is working very well. I can add customfields to a frame, and plusserver STRING messages will send a field. We can extend it to send multiple fields in a single frame via another message type if we want (or v3 style messages with metadata)

> I can add customfields to a frame, and plusserver STRING messages will send a field

Do you use this mechanism for generating a string message from items?

#### 2016-04-26, 21:05:02 - Andras Lasso
Sending custom fields stored in custom frame fields have been working for a while now, but the custom frame fields had to be attached to an image data.

#### 2016-04-26, 21:07:29 - Andras Lasso
Is field data always string? When you mix it with image or tracking data do you always attach the closest value?

#### 2016-04-26, 23:18:23 - Adam Rankin
Yes to closest value.

Re: custom fields always existing
Yes, I know, this just exposes a mechanism to set custom fields without transform or image data, and to package them into a tracked frame for sending over igtlink

Re: string message
Yes, exactly. The message type STRING in the ClientInfo tag. I am testing this portion now

The issue is that ImageToTransducerTransform is not set correctly as a frame field into US image data.

There seems to be an incorrect logic in PlusStatus vtkPlusUsDevice::NotifyConfigured():
if( this->TextRecognizerInputChannelName != NULL )
  {
    if( ImageToTransducerTransform.SetTransformName(this->ImageToTransducerTransformName) != PLUS_SUCCESS )
    {
      LOG_ERROR('Transform name is not properly formatted. It should be of the format <From>ToTransducer.');
      return PLUS_FAIL;
    }
...

this->ImageToTransducerTransform is not set, although this->ImageToTransducerTransformName is not NULL. Please fix this and as a preventive measure, keep either this->ImageToTransducerTransform or this->ImageToTransducerTransformName, but not both.

#### 2016-04-28, 16:37:29 - Andras Lasso
 Reading of ImageToTransducerTransformName from XML is also implemented twice, in vtkPlusSonixVideoSource and vtkPlusUsDevice. Probably it's not needed in vtkPlusSonixVideoSource anymore.

#### 2016-04-28, 19:05:32 - Adam Rankin
This shouldn't be an issue as this code isn't hit. Since this->TextRecognizerInputChannelName is not set, none of the code in the code block is run. I will investigate.

#### 2016-04-28, 20:00:18 - Andras Lasso
if this->TextRecognizerInputChannelName is NULL then conversion from this->ImageToTransducerTransformName to this->ImageToTransducerTransform does not happen. Copy-paste error. But the whole conversion should not be necessary, as it's enough to store the ImageToTransducer transform name in one member variable. I would suggest to just get rid of the this->ImageToTransducerTransform.

My opinion would be to reject support for this device. I downloaded their Windows SDK and ran the provided app. It was unable to find the device. It could have been a driver issue, but I'm not sure. This was on Windows 10 and they only support up to 8.1.

The camera worked under linux using v4l2.

I would recommend support for two webcams managed by OpenCV.

Update to VTK 7.1 caused a lot of build errors. In VTK type of modified time has changed, it is now vtkMTimeType. Please search for all *MTime instances in Plus source code and use vtkMTimeType instead of unsigned long everywhere (also in variables where we store modified time). You could also add the vtkMTimeType typedef in PlusConfigure.h.in for backward compatibility with VTK7.0 and earlier.

#### 2016-11-29, 14:26:20 - Andras Lasso
Probably the build errors are due to missing typedef for VTK 7.0 and earlier. I don't think we need to provide backward VTK compatibility in the trunk at all cost, but it's so simple to add this typedef that it is worth doing it.

From VTKv7\\Common\\Core\\vtkType.h:

Provide this define to facilitate apps that need to support older
versions that do not have vtkMTimeType

#ifndef VTK_HAS_MTIME_TYPE
#if VTK_SIZEOF_LONG == 8
typedef unsigned long vtkMTimeType;
#else
typedef vtkTypeUInt64 vtkMTimeType;
#endif

re #1080 Implementing OpenCL manipulation of images. Images are only on the CPU for capture, and passing to Plus buffer.

Branch: master
Commit: url:https://github.com/PlusToolkit/PlusLib/commit/6b3071f36f2ba09d75f7e93030d78069d1919adc|plus:6b3071f36f


## #1081 File path of PixelDataFile for a meta image sequence data (*.mhd)
Hi all, 

When we are saving a meta Image sequence (*.mhd) with the class of vtkPlusMetaImageSequenceIO, the class set the file path of PixelDataFile as an absolute path.

But, this feature create an error when the saved file was tried to open on Linux or Mac OSX machine. 
To support compatibility of a saved *.mhd file on Linux or Mac OSX machine, I think, we need to use only the file name of pixFileName for PixelDataFile (relative path). 

[1] https://www.assembla.com/spaces/plus/subversion/source/HEAD/trunk/PlusLib/src/PlusCommon/IO/vtkPlusMetaImageSequenceIO.cxx#ln1355

re #1081: Change the file name of PixelDataFile 

-  Change the file name of PixelDataFile within the function of vtkPlusMetaImageSequenceIO::SetFileName() to save a *.mhd
- Use only the file name of pixFileName for PixelDataFile 
- To support compatibility of a saved *.mhd file on Linux or Mac OSX machine.
  * A saved meta file (*.mhd) with the previous code could not open on Linux and Mac OSX machine.
Commit: r:4629|plus:4629

#### 2016-05-13, 18:26:09 - Adam Rankin
Any changes to meta sequence IO should also be applied to nrrd IO.

That being said, we had chosen absolute file paths on purpose.

Why don't the absolute paths work on linux/osx?

#### 2016-05-13, 18:30:16 - Adam Rankin
Apologies, I misunderstood. I thought this was for the header filename.

I think this fix should be fine!

#### 2016-05-13, 18:34:25 - Adam Rankin
Ah... I know why.

Because the header and data file will be written to two different locations if an absolute path if provided in this->FileName.

The proper fix is to improve the close logic to make sure everything gets written to the correct location on disk.

#### 2016-05-13, 18:35:14 - Adam Rankin
(If the file is of type .mhd)

#### 2016-05-13, 18:40:34 - Hyun Jae Kang
Thank you for your comments  and review.

I would like to share my problem.

Here is the header file of my data (USVolumeData.mhd)

---

ObjectType = Image
NDims = 2
AnatomicalOrientation = RAI
BinaryData = True
BinaryDataByteOrderMSB = False
CenterOfRotation = 0 0
CompressedData = False
DimSize = 700 640
ElementNumberOfChannels = 1
ElementSpacing = 1 1
ElementType = MET_UCHAR
Offset = 0 0
TransformMatrix = 1 0 0 1
UltrasoundImageOrientation = MFA
UltrasoundImageType = BRIGHTNESS
Seq_Frame0000_Timestamp = 15.49799999990501
.....
ElementDataFile = C:/Data/USVolumeData/USVolumeData.raw
------------------

In this case, we cannot access the ElementDataFile with the absolute file path on Linux and Mac OSX. 

To open my data, I change the file path of ElementDataFile to USVolumeData.raw.

This is why I made this patch.




#### 2016-05-13, 18:43:16 - Adam Rankin
Yes I understand the problem. Simply changing the PixelDataFile to relative will break the writing of .mhd to the same folder location if this->FileName is given an absolute path.

if:
this->FileName is /home/arankin/dev/output/somefile.mhd
then the pixel data file will be written to:
home/arankin/dev/PlusLib-bin/bin/Output/somefile.raw

If you change the data file to be relative, you will need to make the final file closure logic more advanced.

#### 2016-05-13, 20:05:33 - Hyun Jae Kang
Thank you for your comment.

After the patch, I tested the saving function on Window machine.

A raw file was located with a *.mhd file at a same location.

As like:

C:/Data/USVolumeData/USVolumeData.mhd
C:/Data/USVolumeData/USVolumeData.raw

#### 2016-06-01, 17:23:01 - Andras Lasso
Yes, it's great, it provides real-time HD optical image stream and depth map. Its SDK has many useful features, including built-in 6-DOF object tracking, which allows us to use the camera as a tool tracker. Accuracy seems to be about the same as MicronTracker, just in a smaller field of view (about 1/4). It's very small, light, just needs a USB port, and costs $130.

Yep, I'm using Plus Server on Machine 1 (capturing US and Tracker data) to feed Plus Server on Machine 2

About the configuration ImageToTracker and ReferenceToTracker: first I used a Reference sensor. As reconstruction did not work, I've tried to use trackerdata without a reference sensor, but it did not help to get reconstruction work properly.

#### 2016-07-03, 22:04:16 - Andras Lasso
@rankin There is no need for hardware for testing: you can use PlusDeviceSet_Server_Sim_NwirePhantom.xml config file to test all volume reconstruction features.

#### 2016-07-03, 22:10:05 - reiker

https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=4648F4C014726CE6!310&authkey=!AMW7GJmZvv2ukfU&ithint=folder%2c

phantom.mha is the source, phantom_reconstructed.mha is the the reconstructed volume
capture.avi is a separate recorded US stream.

hope this helps.

#### 2016-07-04, 23:05:43 - emailutsav205789
I have more info:

The output of CreateSliceModels is where it should be
The recon-volume of the Volume Reconstructor needs a transform to rotate it 180 degrees at the end
The individual output frames of the volume reconstructor need to be rotated 180 degrees to get its origin in the right spot, and the 3x3 orientation looks transposed.

#### 2016-07-05, 00:44:15 - Adam Rankin
Thank you for the info! @lassoan does this indicate anything to you?

#### 2016-07-05, 05:39:07 - Andras Lasso
Difference between image and model is due to LPS/RAS coordinate system usage. ITK assumes LPS coordinate system, so when images are imported into Slicer's RAS scene, the volume is transformed by the matrix diag(-1,-1,1,1). Model files are imported without changes.

If you send the reconstructed volume through OpenIGTLink then the volume does not get transformed, so you only see this RAS/LPS difference when you load the volume from file. In that case you need to apply the diagonal transformation matrix:

diag(-1,-1,1,1) = [ -1 0 0 0; 0 -1 0 0; 0 0 1 0; 0 0 0 1]

#### 2016-07-05, 05:51:50 - Andras Lasso

Hi Adam!

Are there any news concerning this bug?

I was on vacation the last weeks.

#### 2016-08-08, 16:54:30 - Andras Lasso
We've tested volume reconstruction with Plus using both real and simulated hardware and everything seems to work well. We couldn't reproduce the problems that you have. We need to set up a skype session with screen sharing (and webcam, if you have physical hardware connected) to see what may be wrong. Contact me in email for scheduling the call.

#### 2016-08-08, 17:30:13 - Adam Rankin
I am unable to reproduce the bug, maybe Andras can help you sort out your issue.

#### 2016-08-09, 16:13:14 - reiker
Hi Adam!

Didn't you say that you where also unable to reconstruct a volume properly? I'm a bit confused now...

But I will write Andras an email.

#### 2016-08-15, 17:47:06 - Adam Rankin
I just re-ran a test setup and volume reconstruction seems to be working as expected. Please reach out to Andras to see if he can determine what is happening with your experiments.

re #1089: Updated baseline to account for a minor spatial calibration result difference

Probably due to ITK update, OPEI test failed due to a small difference in rotation component of the ImageToProbe matrix:
TransformImageToProbe rotation difference (compared to baseline) is higher than expected: 1.0102e-005 degree

Updated baseline to avoid reporting this negligible difference as an error.

I think it's good, but #1088 makes me nervous. There was a point where I was unable to reconstruct a volume. I will test again.

#### 2016-08-15, 17:43:55 - Andras Lasso
We've tested volume reconstruction several times, both with simulation mode and with real hardware and worked well. Something must be wrong with that configuration. I'll check that with reiker if he sets up a remote access session.

## #1092 Current default VTK version does not build with Qt 5.6
In October last year a url:http://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=15703|fix was applied to VTK to not use Qt5WebKitWidgets. Older versions of VTK (including current default 6.2) fail to build with Qt 6.3 and newer. Can VTK7 be the default?

#### 2016-07-11, 16:01:15 - Adam Rankin
Yes I noticed this. It was fixed in the Slicer forks of vtk 6.2/6.3.

Edit: that's a lie... it was not fixed. Nevermind me...

However, the whole issue is avoided by making 7 the default. I have been using 7 for some time, and it seems stable. The only thing I haven't verified is on older compiler versions, as I have moved up to VS2015.

Is your Qt installed or built?

#### 2016-07-12, 20:07:03 - Dzenan Zukic
Installed, I just updated it today (from 5.6.0 to 5.6.1).

#### 2016-07-12, 20:22:56 - Adam Rankin
The only time I've seen those Qt link errors is when the wrong architecture of Qt was sent in

Aka vs2013 qt install when generating Visual Studio 2015

#### 2016-07-12, 20:56:22 - Dzenan Zukic
There are a lot of errors in that case, here is only 44 errors. And if I try building only VTK, here is what I get (boils down to 6 unresolved externals):

re #1093: Force building of dependencies in PlusBuild

Dependencies (ITK, VTK, OpenIGTLink, ...) were not re-built by default when building the top-level PlusBuild solution's ALL_BUILD project. This caused build errors when used libraries were updated (e.g., OpenIGTLink library updated).
Build time (with no changes) increased form about 35 seconds to 60 seconds, which is still tolerable. During development of Plus, it's recommended to open PlusLib and PlusApp solutions in the IDE and build only those.
Commit: r:4740|plus:4740

#### 2016-07-18, 13:53:31 - Dzenan Zukic
@rankin Build with Qt 5.5 and VTK 6.2 did not succeed. Setting Qt5_DIR and friends in to 5.2 in configuration of PlusBuild did not propagate to all the subprojects, and VTK was still pointing to the Qt5 in my path (5.6). When I manually set those paths to 5.2, it then started complaining about Qt5WebKitWidgets. This was with SVN revision 4722.

The default configuration of revision 4740 failed due to Qt5WebKitWidgets. I am now trying 4740 with VTK7.

#### 2016-07-18, 14:27:03 - Dzenan Zukic
The build still fails with the same error

OpenIGTLink_LIBRARY_TARGETS_FILE variable is empty. So either UseOpenIGTLink.cmake needs to include OpenIGTLinkConfig.cmake which sets OpenIGTLink_LIBRARY_TARGETS_FILE, or UsePlusLib.cmake needs to do it.

I also noticed that I am using CMake 3.5.2 and not the latest 3.6.0, so I will try with that now. If that fails I will try to create a patch as proposed in the previous paragraph.

#### 2016-07-18, 14:50:58 - Dzenan Zukic
The same error remains with CMake 3.6.0. Working on the patch.

#### 2016-07-18, 15:33:49 - Dzenan Zukic
In trying to create a patch, I realized why only I have this problem. I have a build of OpenIGTLink located in C:/Dev/OpenIGTLink-build/ (unrelated to any Slicer or Plus builds), and FIND_PACKAGE(OpenIGTLink PATHS 'C:/Dev/plus-2013/Deps/OpenIGTLink-bin' NO_DEFAULT_PATH) finds that build instead of C:\\Dev\\plus-2013\\Deps\\OpenIGTLink-bin.

url:https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.10/cmake.html#command:find_package|Find_Package docs say that PATHS is the last (9th) option searched. The option of setting <package>_DIR worked (it is the 2nd searched option by CMake). I will integrate this into the patch.

#### 2016-07-18, 15:39:44 - Adam Rankin
I will change that from NO_DEFAULT_PATH to NO_MODULE. Could you test to see if that works in your configuration?

Just setting NO_MODULE does not work. I guess it is option 5 or 6 from the url:https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.10/cmake.html#command:find_package|docs which finds the wrong build.

#### 2016-07-18, 15:57:20 - Adam Rankin
Ok, thanks for identifying this. The Use*.cmake file has not seen a lot of attention lately. In another discussion I would like to bring up the possibility of dropping this approach in favor of defining targets in the FIND_PACKAGE(xyz) command.

#### 2016-07-18, 15:58:02 - Adam Rankin
Thank you very much for chasing this down.


## #1094 Dimension reading is incorrect from metafile
Logic for reading MHA is incorrect and results in incorrect reading of single image files

#### 2016-07-12, 18:26:19 - Adam Rankin
There is currently no way to determine if a file is a sequence or a single volume, I propose we add our own custom header tag to differentiate.

IsTimeSequence = TRUE

Slicer and other MHA readers would disregard it and read the file however they would, but Plus generated files can be read more intelligently.

@lassoan thoughts?

Commit: r:4723|plus:4723

#### 2016-07-12, 21:01:58 - Andras Lasso
It's a good idea to add this information. To be a bit more generic and similar to nrrd, I would suggest to add a field that describes the type of each axis, such as 'kinds'.
For time sequence it would be:
kinds = list domain domain
For 3D volume:
kinds = domain domain domain

Now there are many failed tests due to this warning:
|WARNING|000.005000| Kinds not found in file: C:/D/PlusNightly-bin/PlusLibData/TestImages/USTC_FrameGrabber_ProbeRotationData.mha. Treating the last dimension as time.| in C:\\D\\PlusNightly-bin\\PlusLib\\src\\PlusCommon\\IO\\vtkPlusMetaImageSequenceIO.cxx(204)

Probably Kinds property should be added to the test image files (but changing the log level to debug or warning could be OK, too).
Could you please address this? If not then let me know and I can work on it.

#### 2016-07-14, 14:46:49 - Adam Rankin

I see that 'b' is enforced in VTK7 (latest trunk: https://github.com/Kitware/VTK/blob/master/ThirdParty/zlib/vtkzlib/gzlib.c), so the fix may only be required for VTK<7.

#### 2016-07-18, 16:11:09 - Adam Rankin
Could you step into gzopen and see which file is being called? Perhaps somehow you're using the ITK 3rd party?

The uncompressed image contents of the two images are the same. There are some flags in the zlib header that might have different default values.

We may upload a different baseline and choose based on platform; or implement an image comparison tool that uncompresses the image and compares that; but we would also need to compare metadata,... feasible, but quite a bit of work.

## #1097 Allow suppressing accurate timing test failures on virtual machines
AccuateTimerTest fail due to vm on build machine
http://crunch.cs.queensu.ca/CDash/buildSummary.php?buildid=54030

It's normal to not have accurate timing on a VM. We should add a CMake option to relax accurate timer tolerance or remove accurate timer test.

#### 2016-07-18, 17:04:42 - Adam Rankin
My opinion is that this test is most important on developer machines, as they are closer to real-world performance than build machines. I would say the test should be ON by default, and build machines should turn it OFF.

Yes, I agree.

Of course it's important to regularly test this option, so there have to be at least some build machines where this option is enabled.

@rankin On your dashboard computers running on a VM you can now set PLUS_TEST_HIGH_ACCURACY_TIMING=OFF to disable tests (timer accuracy test is still performed, results are reported on the dashboard, but the test always exits with success if PLUS_TEST_HIGH_ACCURACY_TIMING=OFF).

## #1102 Make send/receive timeout configurable
When working with the HoloLens emulator, the 500ms send timeout causes premature disconnects.

By making the timeouts configurable, many situations can be handled.

Thank you, it looks good, just a few small comments:

* Add unit to the end of the variable, e.g., DefaultClientSendTimeoutSec.
* Update user manual (dox files) with the new attributes.

Scoliosis transverse process enhancer (#72)

* re #1108 added basic input, output, and image processing functionality to vtkPlusTransverseProcessEnhancerTest
Modified existing program vtkPlusTransverseProcessEnhancerTest so that it may better test and get outputs from vtkPlusTransverseProcessEnhancer.
command line arguments may be in the following format:
vtkPlusTransverseProcessEnhancerTest.exe --output-config-file=ConfigFile.xml --input-seq-file=BoneUltrasound_L14.mha --output-seq-file=BoneUltrasound_L14_OUT_TEST.mha

Larger additions to vtkPlusTransverseProcessEnhancerTest include:
-more descriptive error messages.
-support for output as a shadow image file, a lines image file, and processed lines image file.

Also changed vtkPlusTransverseProcessEnhancer.cxx so that it better reads and writes information in config files, as a result of this, vtkPlusTransverseProcessEnhancer.h also had to be modified.
vtkPlusTransverseProcessEnhancer.h was not changed in any other way.

* re #1108 Added ways to get various outputs, including various intermediate output images, and an output config file for recording what inputs were used
Added an optional argument to vtkPlusTransverseProcessEnhancerTest to allow for testing vtkPlusTransverseProcessEnhancer's WriteConfiguration() method. Using this argument will cause a config file to be created. This new config file will be filled with the settings that are being used during the current run of the test program. This new config file is intended to be identical to the inputted config file.

Added or expanded on optional arguments for various intermediate outputs, such as:
--output-lines-image-file
--output-intermediate-image-file
--output-shadow-image-file
--output-processedlines-image-file

Rewrote vtkPlusTransverseProcessEnhancer.cxx's WriteConfiguration() using XML_WRITE macros
Added error checking to alternate output files in vtkPlusTransverseProcessEnhancer.cxx

vtkPlusTransverseProcessEnhancer.h was changed to allow for the changes mentioned above.

* re #1108 Added support for intermediate images to be saved throughout different points in the code.

Removed some command line arguments from vtkPlusTransverseProcessEnhancerTest and added the bool argument: --save-intermediate-images which makes the program save various intermediate images before and after steps of the filters. These intermediate images are saved in the same location as where the output file goes, and their file name is: output image file name + _ + an incrementing index + special postfix + .mha ex: BoneUltrasound_L14_TEST_2Lines.mha

In code, the intermediate images are being stored in a dictionary where _ + an incrementing index + special postfix is the key

* re #1108 Finalized ability to save intermediate images in vtkPlusTransverseProcessEnhancer
Ability to save intermediate images while running vtkPlusTransverseProcessEnhancerTest.cxx hes been presumably finished.
Intermediate images are now saved to the local Output folder in a directory named IntermediateImageFiles, then in a sub-directory based on the file's postfex

The programs used to save intermediate images in variables, this has been changed so that it saves them in a map. The reason for this was to simply things, and also to allow for easier future modifications if more intermediate frames are needed.

* re #1108 Changed output so intermediate files are not in different folders

In the previous commit, intermediate images were stored in different folders based on what filter they were associated with. This has been reverted.
Also gave the intermediate and output image files more descriptive names.

* re #1108 Made the ability to read config files more flexible and reliable

Previously, reading config files relied upon <Processor ... > being the first element of the input xml file. This has been changed to allow for <Processor ... > to be anywhere in the config file.

Changed variable name of DilationKernelRadiusPixel to DilationKernelSize so that it remained consistent with other xml files.

* re #1108 Cleaned up codes to make them more readable

-Added comments from Ben
-Removed the code that was commented out
-Moved initialization of <vtkSmartPointer>'s so they are initialized in the constructor
-Removed intermediate images that were redundant
-Changed various variable/function names to be more clear

* re #1108 Fixed a bug the caused intermediate images to be stored in the input file's directory

Intermediate images are now stored in the same directory as where the output file will be saved

* re #1108 Will now always use all fitters unless told otherwise

When processing frames in vtkPlusTransverseProcessEnhancer, all filters will be used unless the the inputted config file says otherwise

* re #1108 Added method to remove images that precede shadow images. Also cleaned up code.

-Added comments from Ben
-Modified some of the default values so that they produce a more accurate result if the user does not input their value.
-Changed variable names to make them more consistent or clear.
-Moved a section of code that processed image extents to its own method.

* re #1108 Removed a TODO that was already implemented

In the last push, a TODO was implemented, but the TODO comment itself was not removed. This has been fixed.

* re #1108 Added pipeline functionality and a check to see if bones start off camera

Changed the way some filters gained their input, so that the code behaves more like a pipeline

Added a step that eliminates bone areas that are located too close to the edge of the camera.
Added a way to determine where each bone area begins and ends.

* re #1108 Fully connected the pipeline. This update doesn't fully work.

Added IslandRemover, ImageEroder, and ImageDialator steps to the pipeline, though they currently only update to a blank image.

Also moved the steps where preceding bone images, and bone images that are off camera are removed. They now happen after the ImageDialator step so as to not interfere with the pipeline.

* re #1108 Fixed issues with the pipeline, and added a check that compares Bone areas to the areas beside them.

In the last commit, the pipeline was fragmented and did not work properly. This issue has since been fixed.
There is also a new function that checks the amount of shadow found in a bone area and compares it to the amount of bone in the areas around it. If the areas surrounding the bone have more shadow, then the area is no longer considered to be a potential bone area.
Also changed the search algorithm so it is more accurate, but recursive.

* re #1108 Added Threshold check based on a column's Standard Deviation

In this commit, the threshold filter was replaced with a check that compared a pixel's value to the standard deviation of the pixels in it's column. If this pixel's value is lower, it is removed.

-Added Documentation
-Cleaned up code
-Fixed minor issue whereby the image was not being returned to the fan image

* re #1108 Changed the search method to be non-recursive, cleaned up code

Replaced the method that was used to find bone areas with one that is non-recursive and faster.
Also moved some code around so that it made more sense.

* re #1108 Bone area search is now based on slope. Added a second island removal step.

The location of bone areas is now determined when pre-bone images are removed, and saved in a class variable for faster, easier access in future. The start and end of bone areas is now determined based on their relative slope to the pixels around them, rather then if they are connected.
Note: the previous way to find bone areas is still in the code, it is just not accessible.

Another island removal step was added after the erosion step to remove smaller islands.

The step for comparing a bone area to the areas next to it was made more flexible, to accommodate large bone areas close it the edge of the screen

* re #1108 added a method to segment bone areas based on their slope

Added in a method that looks at various slopes of each potential bone area. If a slope is too steep, it is divided into a separate bone area.
Also remove the second Island Removal step that was added in the last commit.
Cleaned up code, added comments

* re #1108 Cleaned up code, removed slope comparison method

-Removed the method that compared a bone area's pixels to see the slope it made with the pixels around it.
-Changed variable names to be more clear.
-Added TODO's marking all magic numbers
-Keeps a better log of bone areas to make the code more efficient
-Added comments

I see that, but in this case, I still want the superbuild to check out the dependencies, it's just that PlusBuild itself is not a working copy.

#### 2016-09-26, 16:15:55 - Andras Lasso
I think we should not encourage this use case but if you have a good reason to do so then explain in comments and add a check like this:
IF( EXISTS ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/.svn/ )
  ...
ENDIF()
(see https://cmake.org/pipermail/cmake/2010-April/036361.html)

A minor comment: always use positive variable names. Instead of PLUSBUILD_NOT_WORKING_COPY choose something like PLUSBUILD_SVN_WORKING_COPY. Otherwise you may end up writing funny things like this: NOT PLUSBUILD_NOT_WORKING_COPY.

Thanks!

## #1114 Add visual feedback to temporal calibration line finding
I was inspired by vtkPlusTranverseProcessEnhancer's DrawLine and decided to extract it to PlusCommon.

This ticket is to track progress using that to identify the line found by the temporal calibration in the image coordinate system.

Thank you Adam, this works very nicely!

Would it be easy to show the line while in the temporal calibration tab (and not just during data collection)? Seeing the line helps in finding good imaging settings, scanning position, etc. but now I have to keep clicking on starting the calibration. It's a minor thing, so if it is not very easy to implement then don't worry about it.

#### 2016-10-07, 20:52:42 - Adam Rankin
Do you mean show it before starting the calibration? Currently it only operates in the temporal calibration tab

#### 2016-10-07, 20:57:30 - Andras Lasso
Showing it all the time while we are on the temporal calibration tab. Currently it is only shown if you click Start.

## #1119 Review install of PLUS is fully functional
As per message, instigate a review of PLUS install.

https://app.assembla.com/spaces/plus/messages/5692383

#### 2016-11-01, 15:12:47 - Andras Lasso
Using a pre-built Plus library will only be successful if the application is built with the exactly same compiler and build settings as Plus. It is only feasible on the same computer or in a computer lab where all computer is set up from the same disk image. I'm not sure how frequent this use case is, but if it does not add much complexity to the build/install scripts then it's fine to add this.

It's important to exclude developer files from PlusApplication packages (the packages that we create now that users install). PlusApplication packages should not even contain .h and .lib files to minimize the package size.

## #1121 Interson probe fcal error
We are trying to compile the packages for using interson probes with the Claron Trackers. We have installed all the required software on a 64bit local PC but were unable to run the fcal software. We are getting an error code 0xc0150002. 
Help would be appreciated


#### 2016-11-14, 18:04:26 - Adam Rankin
Are you familiar with DependencyWalker? Could you use it to identify any missing DLLs?

#### 2016-11-14, 18:36:32 - ilkerh
Thanks for the quick reply. I have not used that before. However, I will install it (http://www.dependencywalker.com/) and will get back to you.


#### 2016-11-28, 14:17:46 - ilkerh
Looks like this library file is missing: WDAPI1010.dll
Also if we install the ' Plus Application 2.4.0.4926(Win64) the fcal software starts without any error but that version does not have a interson probe configuration file. Hope this helps to figureout what is missing. If it is easier we can also allow remote access to that computer. 


#### 2016-11-28, 14:35:47 - Andras Lasso
WDAPI1010.dll is part of the driver package for older Interson probes (that Plus installers support out-of-the box). Does Interson's own software work on that computer?
* If yes, then it means that you have the newer type of Interson probes. You need to get the SDK from Interson and build Plus yourself, with PLUS_USE_INTERSONSDKCXX_VIDEO enabled.
* If not, then install Interson drivers and application.

#### 2016-11-28, 15:07:44 - ilkerh
Interson works on the PC. If we have to build PLUS are there any specific instruction we can follow?

## #1124 Captured sequences sometimes saved as 2D images
About 20% of the cases header of captured sequences are corrupted (partly 2D partly 3D). For example:

ObjectType = Image
NDims = 2
AnatomicalOrientation = RAI
BinaryData = True
BinaryDataByteOrderMSB = False
CenterOfRotation = 0 0
CompressedData = False
DimSize = 512 512                    130
ElementNumberOfChannels = 1
ElementSpacing = 1 1
ElementType = MET_UCHAR
Kinds = domain domain               list
Offset = 0 0
TransformMatrix = 1 0 0 1
UltrasoundImageOrientation = MFA
UltrasoundImageType = BRIGHTNESS

The problem is that the logic that decides if a file should be time sequence or not checks the number of tracked frames at the first write. At that time there may be just one frame in the tracked frame list but later more frames are acquired.

Proposed solution: By default metaimage/nrrd writers should create time sequences, so unless there is a specific need to create single-frame data, the dimensions should always include a time dimension.

## #1125 Enable build of PLUS with VTK 7.1
Must be backwards compatible to 7.0

#### 2016-11-29, 16:36:31 - Adam Rankin
Update to VTK 7.1 caused a lot of build errors. In VTK type of modified time has changed, it is now vtkMTimeType. Please search for all *MTime instances in Plus source code and use vtkMTimeType instead of unsigned long everywhere (also in variables where we store modified time). You could also add the vtkMTimeType typedef in PlusConfigure.h.in for backward compatibility with VTK7.0 and earlier.

vtkPlusHapticsDevice.h
=> vtkGetMacro(LastUpdateTime,double);
=> unsigned long LastUpdateTime;

vtkPlusToolAxesActor.cxx
=> unsigned long mTime = this->Superclass::GetMTime();
=> unsigned long mTime = this->GetMTime();

vtkPlusVolumeReconstructor.h
=> unsigned long ReconstructedVolumeUpdatedTime;

Probably the build errors are due to missing typedef for VTK 7.0 and earlier. I don't think we need to provide backward VTK compatibility in the trunk at all cost, but it's so simple to add this typedef that it is worth doing it.

From VTKv7\\Common\\Core\\vtkType.h:

Provide this define to facilitate apps that need to support older
versions that do not have vtkMTimeType

#ifndef VTK_HAS_MTIME_TYPE
#if VTK_SIZEOF_LONG == 8
typedef unsigned long vtkMTimeType;
#else
typedef vtkTypeUInt64 vtkMTimeType;
#endif
#endif

Since ITK and VTK modularization introduced, build command-line lengths increased dramatically - hitting OS limits. The simplest workaround is to build all applications that use ITK and VTK in a very short parent directory (C:\\D\\PlusExp works for me).

Thanks for the developments. It looks good except:
* build errors on the factory
* confusing Qt class naming - should QCustomAction be QPlusCustomAction instead? In most libraries library name prefixes are lowercase (vtkSomething, pqSomething, ctkSomething, ...). Shouldn't we use qPlus... prefix instead?
* vtkPlus... classes in PlusWidgets: I think they should not be part of the Plus library API. I would not spend any time with implementing a new framework for VTK scene visualization - I would always recommend developers to build on existing platforms (Slicer, MITK, CustusX, ...). I wouldn't like to distract our and Plus-using developers attention with these classes - even if it seems that with a little bit of work these classes could be made useful in general for 'simple' applications, this approach is not good (most applications get increasingly complex and this simplistic few classes would not be a good enough foundation; so developers would need to do a painful switch to a better framework then).

Renamed the class to be more descriptive. With regards to prefix, Qt classes are all prefixed Q (QWidget, QLabel, etc...) and subclasses should be named as such.

There are no vtk classes in PlusWidgets, those were all moved -- ooohhh hey, clean checkout showed the error. Those shouldn't be there. Removing now.

## #1137 Volume reconstructor has problems with negative image scaling
Invoking VolumeReconstructor with these parameters _--source-seq-file=UF1.mhd --output-volume-file=UF1.mha --config-file=Config1.xml --image-to-reference-transform=ImageToReference_ produces very strange results. Results are even more mysterious if *NumberOfThreads* >1.

I suspect it has something to do with negative scaling factor in _ImageToUSImage_ matrix. Here is a reconstruction result overlaid with some older settings (ultrasound orientation UN instead of UF, no clipping regions, positive scaling and no Y translation in the _ImageToUSImage_ matrix).

If you can't fix this, can you point me to the right places in code?

#### 2017-01-05, 00:35:53 - Andras Lasso
Probably the issue is that the volume reconstructor expects the image coordinate system to be right-handed. ImageToUSImage matrix has a negative determinant, so it essentially turns the volume inside out. Change the image header in the metaimage file (xN<->xF) and Plus will automatically flip the image into the correct orientation right after it reads it from the file.

For 2D images the orientation can be defined by two letters. I assumed that the third letter is ignored, but apparently it is checked. So, you have to use MN then.

What do you mean? It must have solved the inside-out-turned-fan. What error remained?

You still have to use correct image orientation to get a correctly reconstructed volume.

Clip regions are correct (this is what I want them to be in relations to the ultrasound slice):

With partial optimizations, the result is very similar to full optimization. With optimization set to none, the program crashes in _PlusLib\\src\\PlusVolumeReconstruction\\vtkPlusPasteSliceIntoVolumeHelperUnoptimized.h_ line 329 (Access violation reading location).

Commit: r:5010|plus:5010

#### 2017-01-05, 22:19:21 - Andras Lasso
I've found and fixed two bugs.
1. Crash in pixel-rejection in non-optimized mode was due to copy-paste error in an untested branch (we only use non-optimized mode for debugging, so it is not very well tested)
2. Incorrect clipping fan computation in optimized mode occurred due to the somewhat unusual probe geometry (fan centerpoint being very far out of the image)

I think now the behavior should be correct, but let us know if you still find unexpected results.

re #1142 code cleanup
Commit: r:5025|plus:5025

#### 2017-01-16, 17:02:57 - Andras Lasso
A fundamental concept in Plus is that the pipeline is static. It makes code more robust and simpler.

For example, if there is no recording device I would prefer to return with an error instead of creating a new device. You don't want to create a new device if the user accidentally did not set a recording device or set a wrong ID. It's too easy to lose track of what devices are there. Also, if there are multiple clients and it becomes too easy to create multiple capture devices that take too much resources and the whole server breaks down.

#### 2017-01-16, 17:16:52 - Adam Rankin
If there is no device, then the server must be shut down and restarted with a new configuration file. This is not reasonable when the user simply wants to record a channel.

The code intelligently scans existing capture devices to see if one already suits the requested channel. No extra resources are created compared to a static pipeline that was correctly configured. The main difference between this code and before, is that users do not need to know about capture devices, all they need to know is that they can record what they're seeing.

If the user sets a wrong ID or wrong recording device, then nothing is created. A device is only created if they request to record a specific channel and there does not exist a recording device for that channel.

There is already a multi-client issue, as any client can control a pre-existing capture device as easily as they can control a dynamically created device.

This code is the equivalent of defining a capture device for every single output channel in every single config file ever created. Which is effectively what should be done in every config file to prevent users from not being able to record their procedures.

#### 2017-01-16, 18:49:31 - Andras Lasso
> This code is the equivalent of defining a capture device for every single output channel in every single config file ever created.

We already do this and it's really simple. All devices are consistently listed, there is no question about what devices exist, what parameters are used for recording, etc.

There is no multi-client issue with one capture device: multiple clients can control the same recording device.

You already spent time with implementing this mechanism and I agree that it is unlikely that devices are created unintentionally, but please next time discuss if you plan to make changes that impact the statically defined and verified device list.

'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\Lib\\10.0.10240.0\\um\\x86\\evr.lib'
'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\Lib\\10.0.10240.0\\um\\x64\\evr.lib'
etc...

Are these files not present?

Could you grab the latest PlusBuild and reconfigure the superbuild project?

#### 2017-01-16, 21:51:54 - Dzenan Zukic
The folder _C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\Lib\\10.0.10240.0_ only has subfolder *ucrt*. I tried installing SDK 10.0.14393.33, but that fails, as well as installation of WinSDK as part of Visual Studio. I read somewhere that some version of WinSDK is incompatible with some version of Visual Studio.

Anyway, I will try the updated build system.

#### 2017-01-16, 22:05:11 - Dzenan Zukic
Even with the newest commit, the same SDK is found. This is true even if I replace _mfuuid.lib_ by _evr.lib_ in _TestWindowsSDK.cmake_. Very weird.

#### 2017-01-16, 22:41:54 - Dzenan Zukic
The reason for the error is that TestWindowsSDK is not finding/using the absolute path to those libraries (evr.lib etc), but MfVideoCaptureLibrary is. With the relevant part of *PlusLib\\src\\Utilities\\MfVideoCaptureLibrary\\CMakeLists.txt* modified like this:


~~~~

SET (MfVideoCaptureLibraryLibNames
  Evr
  Mf
  Mfplat
  Shlwapi
  Mfreadwrite
  mfuuid
  Strmiids
  )
# set(MfVideoCaptureLibrary_LIBS)
# foreach(_lib ${MfVideoCaptureLibraryLibNames})
  # set(_libVarName '${_lib}Lib')
  # set('${_libVarName}' '${_lib}-NOTFOUND')
  # FIND_LIBRARY ('${_libVarName}' NAMES '${_lib}' PATHS ${WINDOWS_SDK_LIBRARY_DIRS} NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
  # if ('${${_libVarName}}' STREQUAL '${_libVarName}-NOTFOUND')
    # MESSAGE(FATAL_ERROR 'Library not found in Windows SDK: ${_lib}')
  # endif()
  # LIST(APPEND MfVideoCaptureLibrary_LIBS '${${_libVarName}}')
# endforeach()
set(MfVideoCaptureLibrary_LIBS ${MfVideoCaptureLibraryLibNames})


~~~~


the project configures and builds successfully.

@rankin Do you want to use this style or make TestWindowsSDK use the same style as MfVideoCaptureLibrary?

## #1144 32-bit build problems
Building in 32-bit mode with Interson and Capistrano enabled produces the below build errors. This was done after updating from a working build of Plus.

I can notice a few obvious problems: ToolStateDisplayWidgetTest always uses x64 thus causing conflicts with 32-bit Qt. vtkImageViewer class is no longer available to data collection tests, probably due to superbuild configuration of VTK. And latest cleanup of vtkPlusVirtualDiscCapture was not entirely thorough.

Thanks for reporting these issues. We had to rush in some changes on the trunk recently before/during the project week and we are in the process of fixing these. The stable branch is quite recent and there should be no such issues (and we backported important fixes), so if these instabilities are too frustrating then you may consider to switch (but hopefully it will be just a transient and all build errors will be fixed very soon).

Most errors are captured by the dashboard (we have 32-bit and 64-bit builds using multiple compilers), so we are aware of those. Unfortunately we don't have Capistrano SDK, so we cannot add nightly tests with that. @dzenanz It would be great if you could add a nightly build with that device enabled.

## #1146 vtkPlusUSDigitalEncodersTracker no longer works
Some recent changes to PlusLib have broken this tracker type. Configuration file PlusDeviceSet_Server_MmfUSDigitalEncodersTracker_coreXY.xml was a working example some time ago. Now the transform is not updated any more.

My collaborator reports 'If I change the PortName parameter in the Plus XML configuration file from 'CoreXY' to 'XAxis', the 'ReferenceToUSImage' transform updates in the Slicelet with encoder movement.'

I added the coreXY functionality to that class, and chose _PortName_ as an indicator that it is a url:http://corexy.com/theory.html|coreXY combination of two motors, and not just a regular compounding of stages (and thus transforms). But I suppose some recent changes were modifying DataSource IDs and port names which broke this class.

#### 2017-01-23, 16:58:25 - Adam Rankin
The configuration for that device has some odd redundancies. The from and to fields in the data source tags should not be there. The transformation name is defined as {ID}to{ToolReferenceFrame}.

There is also the persistent flag, indicating persistent transforms. These should be in the <CoordinateDefinitions> section which makes it available to the top level transform repository in the data collector.

The above issue likely stems from the inconsistencies with this device and the general design of devices. 

@lassoan Do you have the time/availability to refactor the device?

#### 2017-01-23, 20:47:57 - Andras Lasso
@dzenanz, could you please move all constant transforms to the top-level <CoordinateDefinitions> element and see if things work then? If not, then I can have a look, but need step-by-step instructions for reproducing the problem on my computer.

#### 2017-01-23, 22:39:03 - jperdomo

Thanks for tackling this.

I would have prefered the 'static registry' (https://app.assembla.com/spaces/plus/messages/5743123) approach because:
- automatically takes care of all instances
- compatiblilty was really 'safe'
- devices have to be registered 'after' factory creation
- the object does not have to be passed and to me the information (devicetyperegsitry) always was 'global' information, so why go out of your way to make it into an object.

But I guess I can live with this approach. :)

## #1148 Importance mask compounding mode
Enable smooth blending of tracked frames in volume reconstructor by introducing a new compounding mode: *importance mask*. _ImportanceMaskFilename_ provides a file with same dimensions as tracked frame, and each pixel in the importance mask gives a weight for compounding. Compare this with *Mean* compounding mode in which each pixel is given weight of 256 (ACCUMULATION_MULTIPLIER).

If *ImportanceMask* is constructed in such a way that pixels near the edges of the frame have low weight, and those in the middle of the frame have progressively higher weight, the result will be smooth blending in the overlapping regions. A simple way to construct such an ImportanceMask is to construct a distance field on the clipping region which can be obtained from DrawClipRegion tool.

This approach is far more efficient that computing distance field from clip region for each frame. It is also somewhat more flexible, allowing other weights to be applied to a frame besides distance field.

Should I add some automated tests for it? If yes, should I also test partial optimization (which does not suffer from fixed-point overflows) and/or nearest neighbor which has visible gaps in the reconstruction (when spacing of the reconstructed volume is close to spacing of input frames)?

Pull request on GitHub would be my preferred process. There are already volume reconstructor tests that are currently broken. If you are able to identify and fix the tests, that would be great.

@dzenanz Please double-check if importance mask based VR is correct in vtkTrilinearInterpolation in PlusLib\\src\\PlusVolumeReconstruction\\vtkPlusPasteSliceIntoVolumeHelperCommon.h. If importance pointer is correctly computed and it works well for single-component and multi-component input/output.

Hi Ole!

When did you fork the pluslib repo? The reason I ask is I had to destroy and recreate it to proprely import the branches.

If you did it a while ago, you'll have to re-clone the repo, and copy over the files (excluding .git folder) from the old clone to the new clone.

Apologies!

#### 2017-05-12, 11:40:02 - Andras Lasso
PlusLib does not use Qt (other than having some common widgets defined there for convenience, but that's an optional component), so this would not be feasible. Several users not use Qt at all, so we should not add this dependency to any device. You should be able to use VTK or OpenIGTLink OS-independent socket classes.


#### 2017-05-12, 12:37:34 - Andras Lasso
I fully agree with replacing GrabbieLib, as it is overcomplicated (it seemed, it was intended to do much more, but probably they did not have enough time) and really messy.

#### 2017-05-12, 12:58:53 - Ole Vegard Solberg
Ok, I will probably use OpenIGTLink classes instead then.

#### 2017-05-12, 13:03:32 - Andras Lasso
OK. I think OpenIGTLink sockets have been extracted from VTK a couple of years ago, and Device classes already depend on VTK (but not on OpenIGTLink) so it might be easier to use vtkSocket classes, but it's up to you.

#### 2017-05-24, 09:26:22 - Ole Vegard Solberg
I ended up using vtkClientSocket, and my version of the BK interface now runs on OSX. However, it don't work on my Windows build: It seems VTK fails in creating sockets (vtkSocket.cxx line 145).

#### 2017-05-24, 12:48:04 - Andras Lasso
Is the code available on your fork? I could test it on my computer, too.

#### 2017-05-25, 07:25:40 - Ole Vegard Solberg
Yes everything is pushed to my fork. I'm working on the branch: us-sector-info.
You don't need any scanner to test this particular bug, as it fails when asking for a socket.
Just comment out #define OFFLINE_TESTING at the top of vtkPlusBkProFocusOemVideoSource.cxx.
You have to set ScannerAddress and OemPort in PlusDeviceSet_Server_BkProFocusOem.xml, as I don't use the IniFile.ini file:
    <Device

      Type='BkProFocusOem'

## #1150 Use of old stdint.h files creates compiler errors
In GrabbieLib there are two old stdint.h files ( pltools/trunk/BK/ProFocus/GrabbieLib-1.1.0/AcquisitionLibrary/stdint.h and pltools/trunk/BK/ProFocus/GrabbieLib-1.1.0/ParametersLibrary/stdint.h ).
These file don't follow the C++11 standard and (sometimes) cause build errors when enabling PLUS_USE_BKPROFOCUS_VIDEO, like:
C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\\VC\\include\atio(111): error C2065: 'INTMAX_MAX': undeclared identifier [C:\\dev\\PlusB-bin\\PlusApp-bin\\fCal\\fCal.vcxproj] [C:\\dev\\PlusB-bin\\PlusApp.vcxproj]
(see also: http://crunch.cs.queensu.ca/CDash/viewBuildError.php?buildid=64446)

I suggest we just delete the stdint.h files if there isn't a good reason they were added in the first place?

#### 2017-01-31, 02:14:26 - Andras Lasso
I don't see why would Plus need to know how applications want to store transforms. We just send the transforms according to OpenIGTLink specification and the client can do whatever it needs.
Why not just convert the transform in the client?

## #1152 INSTALL target does not create computer-independent cmake files
This issue has previously been addressed in a patch for svn, now adapted for my git repository. It was partially implemented in '* re #1010 Installing header files to include directory, adding xml files to share directory' ff (72303f4 ff.).

c.f. https://app.assembla.com/spaces/plus/messages/5692383

I should also be pointed out, that the commit introduces install path variables to the cmake to make install path handling easier (CMakeLists.txt) as well as installs some of the Testing/Utilities Targets.

One example from src/PlusCalibration/CMakeLists.txt:

target_include_directories(vtkPlusCalibration PUBLIC ${PlusCalibration_INCLUDE_DIRS} )

This adds the absolute paths in ${PlusCalibration_INCLUDE_DIRS} to the target, which later on will be exported as computer dependent absolute path to the 'installed' Targets file.

@lassoan I do not quite get, why the Ticket was changed to 'Invalid'. The usage of absolute paths in the 'install interface' breaks the ability to copy the files and folders from one computer to another. And the addition of this feature does not 'break' anything else, it just makes the install target more consistent.

## #1159 VolumeReconstructor ignores OutputExtent and OutputOrigin
SetOutputExtentFromFrameList is called regardless of whether OutputExtent and OutputOrigin were specified in the configuration file. If this call is skipped manually during debugging, this error occurs:

This prevents setting custom output extent to skip unwanted part of volume from being reconstructed, e.g. for quicker debugging (breakpoints with conditions slow down execution speed excruciatingly).

#### 2017-05-11, 16:04:58 - Andras Lasso
Current origin and extent values are saved to XML, so users keep copying those values along with other volume reconstruction parameters. It is very rare that you know origin and extent in advance. So, the values in the config file are most of the time these copy-pasted values, which would not generate meaningful volumes.

For the very rare occasion when a user intentionally sets origin and extent in the XML, the new flag could be used to bypass automatic extent computation.

In VTK7.1 by default OpenGL2 rendering backend is used, which requires OpenGL features that are not available when you connect to a remote computer using RDP (Microsoft Remote Desktop). To resolve this, you can use TeamViewer or VNC to connect; or use legacy OpenGL rendering backend (or as you did it, change tests so that they don't use OpenGL or allow disabling parts that require OpenGL).

#### 2017-02-11, 19:58:08 - Andras Lasso
Possibility of checking OpenGL version has come up several times on the VTK mailing list since OpenGL2 (many people suffer from this increased OpenGL version/extensions requirement) but there is no solution yet.

## #1164 Convert const char* to std::string
In general, I support moving from const char* to std::string. However, it has to be done much more carefully than done in the recent code changes.

1. VTK almost everywhere stores empty string as NULL pointer. You can pass a const char* NULL pointer wherever string is accepted and it crashes the application (no problem reported compile-time). I would seriously consider waiting for VTK to make a move from const char* to a string class, because otherwise we have to put a null-pointer check at each place where we get a string from VTK and at some places we may have to convert empty strings to null pointers when setting values in VTK classes. Introducing some new macros may help in this (for example a SAFE_STR macro that converts null pointer to an empty string object).

2. If the move from const char* to a string class will be made then probably that string class won't be a simple std::string but something more sophisticated, that can at least handle character encoding. It may be vtkUnicodeString or some new string class.

3.  If we decide to switch, then we have to change the code everywhere at once, otherwise the chance of casting const char* to string is too high.

4. Returning const string& is not a trivial replacement of returning const char*. Every method that returns it and every method that uses the returned value must be thoroughly reviewed if the behavior is correct (it can go wrong many ways, without any compile-time errors). String should be returned by value, unless exceptional cases where we find measurable performance degradation. Performance impact should be insignificant in most cases, as many std::string implementations use reference counted pointers for the bulk data (so you won't copy lots of memory); also return-value-optimization may alleviate actual object copy. Often returning const std::string& is not feasible, for example when you construct a value locally - it's much cleaner if you can just return a string regardless if there is a corresponding member variable or not (with const char* it's a bit easier because at least you can return pointer to a string literal).

5. Use standard vtkSetMacro/vtkGetMacro with the string class to get/set values or maybe add a new specialized string macro pair vtkGet???StringMacro/vtkSet???StringMacro to perform null-pointer checks, etc.

vtkSetMacro/vtkGetMacro do not support const getters, we could add that to our own macro.

#### 2017-02-13, 01:22:41 - Andras Lasso
Let's find a reasonable answer to all the 5 points above before making any more code changes.

re #1164: Fixed crash due to setting NULL in std::string

Added vtkSetStdStringMacro and vtkGetStdStringMacro to get/set std::string members. It is robustly handles getting NULL pointer as input (treats it as empty string).
Updated most std::string get/set functions to use these macros.

Added get/set macros for setting variables in non-VTK classes and vtkGetMacroConst to retrieve values when only a const pointer is available to an object.

#### 2017-03-06, 16:40:23 - Adam Rankin
@OleVegard.Solberg Any follow-up?

#### 2017-03-08, 12:21:55 - Ole Vegard Solberg
Sorry for the delay. I realise my bug-report was a bit thin, I will try to give some more info:

I'm working on our fork of PlusLib: https://github.com/SINTEFMedtek/PlusLib It is probably a few weeks behind.

On the server I'm using PlusDeviceSet_Server_BkProFocusOem.xml as configuration. I use #define OFFLINE_TESTING in vtkPlusBkProFocusOemVideoSource.cxx

I use OpenIGTLinkIO for the client (our fork: https://github.com/SINTEFMedtek/OpenIGTLinkIO). I'm trying to send a CommandQuery with OpenIGTLinkIO: Session::SendCommandQuery(device_id, command, content), where 
device_id = 'VideoDevice'
command = 'RequestDeviceChannelIds'
content = '<Command Name=\\'RequestDeviceChannelIds\\' />'

I assumed the problem was in plus since, as the debug log shows, it looks like plus don't use the device id from the OpenIGTLink message.
I see now that if I instead put the device id in the message content like this: content='<Command Name=\\'RequestDeviceChannelIds\\' DeviceId=\\'VideoDevice\\' />' I get the answer I'm looking for.
I also see you have listed DeviceId as attribute in the command description :)
I guess the confusion here is that device id is both a part of the OpenIGTLink message and an attribute to the command content. Is this the same device id or are they different?

 

#### 2017-03-08, 14:46:47 - Adam Rankin
Ah yes, sadly they are different. I would be agreeable to changing the attribute tag to PlusDeviceId, @lassoan thoughts?

OpenIGTLink DeviceId is a very multipurpose field, as the original spec was limited in flexibility. I think we use it to send transform names, image embedded transform names, etc...

#### 2017-03-08, 16:19:12 - Andras Lasso
Device ID in OpenIGTLink is kind of a context identifier. Defines the 'topic' for the data transfer. For example, for an OpenITGLink command there could be multiple independent command processors and then device ID would be then used for choosing the command processor.
The 'device' term is used in Plus for data collection classes (derived from vtkPlusDevice). These devices has nothing to do with OpenIGTLink devices.
In Plus code, OpenIGTLink and Plus devices are well separated: only PlusServer and PlusOpenIGTLink are aware of OpenIGTLink protocol; PlusDataCollection library (and the rest of the toolkit) doesn't know about OpenIGTLink at all.

It would be nice to avoid using the same 'device' word for two completely different things. For example, we could replace the 'device' with some other word throughout Plus? It would not be easy to find a suitable word (connection? but that's already used, ..) and not a small task to replace it everywhere.

#### 2017-04-06, 15:55:01 - Adam Rankin
Closing as invalid as no changes are needed. If a discussion on naming is desired, a new ticket should be created.

We should probably allow plus server to run without an output channel and/or put serial device output into the item buffer (if there device did not provide any output then we can put empty string in the field data).

## #1180 Add new video source : IntersonArraySDKCxx
The vtkIntersonArraySDKCxxVideoSource is added along with the Tests.

PLUS_USE_INTERSONARRAYSDKCXX_VIDEO

CMake configuration variable.

#### 2017-04-07, 14:46:29 - Adam Rankin
What is the difference between the IntersonSDKCxx and IntersonArraySDKCxx? Is it just a probe model? If they use the same underlying SDK, their should only be one device type that supports multiple probes.

## #1181 Enable support for System zlib
Enable better integration with Slicer. When Plus is pointed to ITK and VTK from Slicer's build, link error 'cannot open input file 'vtkzlib.lib'' is url:https://app.assembla.com/spaces/plus/messages/5799593|encountered.

In Slicer's superbuild ITK's internal zlib is turned off and Slicer-provided 'system' zlib is used. In VTK internal zlib is not built by default, and in Slicer's superbuild VTK is pointed to Slicer-provided 'system' zlib too.
We therefore need to implement ITK/VTK-like USE_SYSTEM_ZLIB mechanism in Plus. Specifically, use the below CMake defines to enable usage of another zlib build:


~~~~

    -DPLUS_USE_SYSTEM_ZLIB:BOOL=ON
    -DZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=...
    -DZLIB_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=...


~~~~



#### 2017-04-27, 13:34:07 - Andras Lasso
fixes #1181 Support building PlusLib as part of Slicer's superbuild

ExternalProject_Add's CMAKE_CACHE_ARGS should have these:
  -DPLUS_USE_SYSTEM_ZLIB:BOOL=ON
  -DZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=${ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR}
  -DZLIB_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=${ZLIB_LIBRARY}
  -DITK_NO_IO_FACTORY_REGISTER_MANAGER:BOOL=ON

PLUS_USE_SYSTEM_ZLIB should be used in cases when ITK's and VTK's internal zlib build has been disabled.

ITK_NO_IO_FACTORY_REGISTER_MANAGER should be used in all the programs and libraries using itk::ImageFileReader and itk::ImageFileWriter classes. This makes sure there is only a single ITK I/O factory manager.

## #1182 Plus Server Launcher does not recognize .XML (capital) files
The Plus Server Launcher ignores any configuration files that have a '.XML' (note the capitalization) extension. It would be nice if the Plus Server Launcher could recognize these files too.

Here is my workflow that lead to this:
1. I created a new Plus Config file called: PlusDeviceSet_Server_Ascension3DG_HMA.xml.
2. I sent this config file to a colleague using Microsoft Outlook (which automatically capitalized the file extension without notice).
3. The colleague saved the file to his computer and tried to select it in the Plus Server Launcher.
4. The file did not appear in the selector widget as a device set configuration.

Making the extension lower case fixed the problem, and the file became available in the device set configuration widget.

## #1184 PlusLib only properly creates installs for Release Configuration
PlusLib should also allow for RelWithDebInfo and Debug installations, if the User wishes to.
Currently all installs are restricted mostly to Release. I think the user can be assumed to know, that the install he produces will be performed with the currently selected build type.
Also (as a feature) build types that provide PDBs should include these, if they are available (this is to make debugging easier).

--> Release build will work unchanged, RelWithDebInfo and Debug are supported.

## #1188 Make Ascension measurement hemisphere configurable
Posted by Matthew Holden on 2017-05-08 09:59 

I am using the Acension 3DG trakStar for several different projects, and for each setup I use a different hemisphere for the sensors in the Ascension tracker. In particular, for one application I use the FRONT hemisphere for all sensors, and for another application I use the TOP hemisphere for all sensors.

But I find that it is easy to forget to change the hemisphere through the Ascension trakStar utility.

Is there a way to set the hemisphere for the Ascension sensors through the PLUS config file?

@mholden8 I've implemented a common Hemisphere parameter. I haven't tested it, so please do so and let me know if it works. Add Hemisphere='FRONT' (BACK, LEFT, RIGHT, ...) in the config file to specify the hemisphere. Either build Plus or wait for tomorrow's nightly build.

#### 2017-05-08, 16:27:22 - Matthew Holden
@lassoan Thanks for looking into this so promptly. I will test with tomorrow's nightly build.

#### 2017-05-09, 13:40:30 - Matthew Holden
I tested this morning with the latest nightly. Everything works as expected.

The new default behaviour is FRONT, but previously the default behaviour was to use whatever was set in the trakStar utility. PLUS users who want to use a non-FRONT hemisphere can no longer set it in the trakStar utility, but must set it in the PLUS config file. This behaviour is consistent with the way PLUS treats other parameters for the Ascension tracker.

## #1195 'No command' for Automatic MOC, UIC and RCC for target PlusWidgets
This consistently happens on a laptop with WinProbe ultrasound system. I can't figure out what is wrong. The build log is below. The important error messages are on the first 10 lines or so.

What CMake, Qt, Visual Studio version do you use?

#### 2017-05-15, 23:43:53 - Adam Rankin
Can you upload your CMakeCache.txt as well?

#### 2017-05-16, 17:15:39 - Dzenan Zukic

$ qmake --version
QMake version 3.1
Using Qt version 5.8.0 in C:/Qt/5.8/msvc2015_64/lib

Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2015 for Windows Desktop
Version 14.0.25431.01 Update 3
Visual C++ 2015   00325-20000-00000-AA613
(But this was also happening on VS2015 community edition)

CMake 3.8.1

CMakeCache.txt attached.

#### 2017-05-16, 17:17:51 - Andras Lasso
I'm not sure if CMake fully supports Qt-5.8. Try with Qt-5.7.

#### 2017-05-16, 17:30:47 - Dzenan Zukic
Qt 5.8 works great on my other computer. Which is what baffles me.

#### 2017-05-16, 17:41:37 - Andras Lasso
CMake 3.8 has issues, too. You could try with CMake 3.7.

Also, your path is quite long: C:/Users/WinProbe/Documents/Plus64WPa/. There can be random errors in VTK and ITK based projects that use a root path that is longer than about 10 characters.


#### 2017-05-16, 17:49:38 - Dzenan Zukic
Dammit! The long path issue - I forgot about it. I will try a shorter path.

#### 2017-05-17, 16:04:36 - Dzenan Zukic
The long path was the issue :(

Thanks Andras!

#### 2017-05-17, 19:36:15 - Andras Lasso
Actually, this error and the solution has been described in detail in the 'Troubleshooting' section of the Windows build instructions (note added many months ago).

status: changed from "New" to "Invalid"


## #1196 Add device that uses ArUco marker tracking library
* Use latest official git
* Upload our hack to https://github.com/PlusToolkit/ArUco
* Send a pull request to official version on SourceForge, see what happens (they merge as is, ignore, implement a nice solution instead, ...)
* Add aruco build to PlusBuild
* Add device vtkPlusOpticalMarkerTracker that uses ArUco library



#### 2017-05-15, 16:42:05 - Andras Lasso
Use vtkPlusIntelRealSenseTracker as an example (clone and modify). vtkPlusImageProcessorVideoSource is an example how to use another device's output as input.

#### 2017-05-15, 18:34:11 - Adam Rankin
Let me know if I can help. I'd like this.

ArUco is in the SVN/git history (not sure which one).

What's your hack?

#### 2017-05-15, 20:03:29 - Andras Lasso
The problem is that .lib and .dll filenames are hardcoded in the official repository, but the actual filenames are different on Linux/Windows. Our hack is to add an if(WIN32)..else()..endif() and hardcode different filenames for Windows and other platforms. I would not spend time with improving the ArUco build system unless there is a high chance that the maintainers would accept those. As a first step, we submit this simple (and ugly solution) and see how they deal with it.

At some point, log messages should be cleaned up. For example, it should not be logged as an error if a marker cannot be found.

#### 2017-06-29, 14:14:17 - Adam Rankin
I feel like the CMake for the aruco device could be more smoothly handled. Would you consider changing the CMake to auto-select dependent options instead of reporting they aren't selected?

For example, if the user selects PLUSBUILD_USE_aruco, then .._USE_OpenCV should auto-self-select
Same with OPTICAL_MARKER -> aruco -> OpenCV

Thoughts?

#### 2017-06-29, 14:14:42 - Adam Rankin
(This would happen during the first configure after the user selected an option)

#### 2017-07-01, 00:49:42 - Andras Lasso
I would be hesitant to automate this, just because very smart people tried to automate this for example in CTK and in Plastimatch build systems, and in both cases the result is a catastrophy. While I agree that a few mouse clicks could be saved by automating the process, developers would lose control and they would often need to resort to trial and error when they configure their project to figure out what they can and they can not do. For example, if you don't want to use a specific dependency then it is really difficult to configure your project if there is an automatic dependency enabling mechanism.

## #1200 MmfVideoSource error following 'replacing direct string compare with case insensitive compare'
I have had problems using a Mmf video device following the specific PlusLib commit 'url:https://github.com/PlusToolkit/PlusLib/commit/b40d15554fee40eeb5454ec0bae6f2d1dbde38de#diff-691c67d6e40ad504b8dcdef2cdb43d32|re #1182 replacing direct string compare with case insensitive compare'.  For instance, if I run vtkmmfvideosourcetest.exe with the command-line arguments '--list-video-formats', the list is not generated and a error dialog box opens as shown below:
image:a3Grtmp1Wr54kadmr6CpXy|mmfvideobug.PNG

From the specific commit mentioned above, I reverted the changes made specifically to the url:https://github.com/PlusToolkit/PlusLib/commit/b40d15554fee40eeb5454ec0bae6f2d1dbde38de#diff-691c67d6e40ad504b8dcdef2cdb43d32|vtkPlusMmfVideoSource.cxx file and rebuilt.  I was then able to stream using my mmf video device again and had no problems running the same vtkmmfvideosourcetest that lists the available video formats.

re #1204: Fixed 'Trying to delete object with non-zero reference count' error

vtkInternal class was a VTK object but created/deleted with plain new/delete (VTK objects must be created/deleted using New() and Delete() methods).

Usually vtkInternal is not a vtkObject-based class, so followed that convention and removed the vtkObject parent.

## #1220 Latest PLUS cannot connect to Interson probe
I am using the Interson USB ultrasound probe (GV 5.0). I cannot connect to the the probe using the latest. Both the stable release PlusApp-2.4.0.5112-Interson-MTC-3.7-Win32 and the nightly PlusApp-2.5.0.20170722-Interson-MTC-3.7-Win32 exhibit this behaviour.

Note that I can successfully connect using an older version of PLUS: PlusApp-2.2.0.4177-Interson-MTC-3.6-Win32.

I am using the standard configuration file that is distributed with the download (I've attached it for convenience).file:b9hR0sFhar56xdacwqjQYw|PlusDeviceSet_Server_IntersonVideoCapture.xml

## #1221 Support for NDI Polaris broken in Plus-2.5


#### 2017-08-09, 14:28:12 - Adam Rankin
Can you be more specific? Which device? Which firmware?

#### 2017-08-09, 14:28:58 - Adam Rankin
And are you sure you're on the latest ndicapi?

#### 2017-08-09, 14:29:41 - Mark Asselin
@rankin I tried connecting to our Polaris Spectra using the latest nightly again this morning, both with and without specifying the COM port # in my config file.  To no avail.  I can connect to the tracker using NDITrack and the stable release of Plus using the same config file. The firmware revision is 015.

## #1224 vtkPlusOpenIGTLinkVideoSource not sending embedded image transform name in TRACKEDFRAME messages
Sending server is unable to send frames to the client as the embedded image transform name is mandatory

#### 2017-08-18, 14:21:19 - Adam Rankin
I see. Tracked frames might be sent without embedded image transform?

## #1225 32->64 volume reconstruction is empty in Slicer
With example setup (saved data)

PlusDeviceSet_Server_Sim_NwirePhantomTrackedFrameProcessing.xml
PlusDeviceSet_Server_Sim_NwirePhantomTrackedFrameAcquisition.xml

scout scan produces data, live volume reconstruction does not

#### 2017-08-18, 19:34:09 - ppandey
What are the results with offline reconstruction on saved data?

#### 2017-08-21, 16:32:40 - ppandey
Origin (placement) of reconstructed volume is incorrect and physical dimensions of the reconstruction seems to be incorrectly dependant on the output spacing parameter when testing offline reconstruction.

https://github.com/PlusToolkit/PlusLib/blob/master/src/PlusDataCollection/SonixVideo/vtkPlusSonixVideoSource.cxx#L136

This function is being called at the update rate indicated on the Ultrasonix console. This leads me to believe that the problem is somewhere in Plus.


## #1227 AcquisitionRate is not updated in vtkPlusSavedDataSource when UseOriginalTimestamps='TRUE'
AcquisitionRate remains 10, leading fCal to believe that the fastest it can record frames is 10FPS.

This should be updated to reflect the actual FPS of the original timestamps.


## #1228 Add support for compressed video transfer through OpenIGTLink
Imaging speed could be improved by using video compression methods.
Some support has been already added in OpenIGTLink and OpenIGTLinkIO.

## #1229 Use Motive API instead of NatNet SDK for OptiTrack support
Using the Motive API allows us to track rigid bodies with OptiTrack tracking systems without having to run the Motive GUI application.

## #1230 add RigidBodyAddFromFile() function from the ndi oapi
similar to how RigidBodyAddFromDeviceHandle is being used currently.
